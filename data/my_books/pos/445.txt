I received my first copy of this cute album as a gift when I had my first baby.  I had so much fun putting it together that I tracked it down for my second and now for my third.  Telling the story from baby's point of view is fun and gets mom thinking about how baby would really feel about all the firsts in his/her life.  It is an easy album for moms and dads who want to record all the important events that the first year brings, but who haven't joined the scrapbooking craze quite yet.  I love this album and plan to have one for each child
