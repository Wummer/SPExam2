I'm not even a vegetarian , let alone a vegan, and this book offers such flavorful and simple recipes.  Some more time consuming than others but definitely worth the wait!  Unless you hate veggies, this book is a must have!  I just made the Herb Scalloped potatoes as a side dish and the author was right, it's hard to believe there's no cheese or cream! the pizza with caramelized onions, kalmata olives and tomatoes is fantastic too!. . . . .lots of yummyness
