This book is an almost encylocpedic digest of current theories of thoroughbred handicapping.  None are covered in such detail that you can run off and start making money at the track, but each points you to a source for more comprehensive information on the theory that interests you.  

If you are willing to ignore books on "handicapping made easy," this book is probably among the best starting points for the novice.  It explores a variety of approaches, leaving you to select what you like, and follow a path toward mastery
