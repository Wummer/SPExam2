This book is more dated than THE SECRET GARDEN, but it's still a great story. It's hard NOT to identify with Sara Crewe.

I loved this book as a child (though not as much as I loved THE SECRET GARDEN, which I think is a better book). However, A LITTLE PRINCESS may appeal more to some people; some readers may find the story stronger and the main character, Sara Crewe, more likable. Sara's determination to stay herself despite how other people treat her and view her is inspiring and may help readers through tough times of their own. Some scenes (I don't want to spoil the surprise by describing them) are magical.  

A LITTLE PRINCESS is a great story that makes readers think. Some of those thoughts make you uncomfortable, like the thoughts about differences between rich and poor children - but that (I think) is part of the book's greatness. 

Be sure to get an unabridged edition: this book is beautifully written and should not be simplified. Kids now CAN read and will love this book: at least, every girl to whom I have given a copy has read it and reread it -- on her own.

For a modern, well-written book about another girl at an English boarding school, read Libby Koponen's BLOW OUT THE MOON. It has the same classic feel, though American heroine is very different from Sara in some ways (though she too is determined to hang onto her identity) and MOON is quite funny
