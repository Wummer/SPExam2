I am a manager for a Federal Govt Agency.  I found this book informational and easy to understand.  Immigration law is a complex subject.  The book is easy to read and addresses many important aspects related to this subject.  The sections related to inadmissability, removal are well written and easy to understand.  The chapters related to the history of various classes of immigrants was intersting as well.  I would recommend the book for persons who want to expand their knowledge of this topic
