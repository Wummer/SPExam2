Wow!!!  This is a ton of great information from a 'been there, done that' Mom and Grandma.  

The author shares wisdom, humor and stories all wrapped in grace...  
(I loved that I could read it and be inspired to be better, encouraged for the great things I AM doing, but not feel guilty about all the stuff I'm NOT doing.)   

This is a celebration  of the family. I think I might make it my new standard baby shower gift!!
