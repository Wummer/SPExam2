 I made 4 dishes from the book for my girlfriends and all of the recipes were a huge hit.  The carmelized onion and spinach dip was amazing as well as the tomato and ginger soup.  I especially like the 'buy and arrange' features  which give you clever stylish ideas for easy dishes to throw together if you don't have alot of time. No more 3 course meals for me, I'm going all appetizers.
