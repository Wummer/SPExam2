I evolved into a lower carb nutrition by finding first that I needed more protein than I had thought and that I reacted strongly to sugars.  I bought this book when I decided to lose a few pounds, but wanted to understand any health implications related to a low carb diet.  I was already having gall bladder and liver issues.  I bought this book first and 2.5 years later, it is still the best reference I have.  The chapter on hormones is a bit technical, but this chapter alone is worth the price of the book.  

Within three days of eliminating grains from my diet, I no longer cared whether or not I lost weight.  My awful blood sugar drops and painful bloating were gone, my energy increased significantly and within weeks I noticed that the gall bladder pain was gone (and it hasn't come back).  Within three months my intense hot flashes disappeared and I started sleeping better.  

The book first describes what low carb nutrition is, then goes on to discuss hormones and how insulin impacts the overall balance of the body's hormones in different ways.  It addresses overall energy, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, gastrointestinal disorders, vitamins and minerals, and weight control (one chapter - the rest is on health issues).
