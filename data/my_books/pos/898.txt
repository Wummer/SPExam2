I love to browse through different cookbooks.  I have quite a collection, and usually go to the library to find new recipes to try before I decide to purchase the entire book.  I normally look for 3 things in a cookbook, besides delicious recipes that will work for my family.  This includes:
1)  Pictures of more than 3/4 of the recipes (Color pictures are the best)
2)  A spiral binding, or at least one that easily lays flat
3)  New A innovative recipes that have ingredients I can easily find at a grocery store

I also prefer if the cookbook lists all of the nutrient information including sodium, fat content, protein, fiber, and carbohydrates.

I picked up this book to find new ideas to make a quick meal in-between working and shuffling the kids to various sporting and school events.  Let's face it, eating out isn't always the best for you, especially since you cannot always tell exactly how much fat or sodium you are ingesting.  I wanted some new recipes to try, but not necessarily a dish that would have my kids eyeing it suspiciously and saying "what is it?".  I was not disappointed.

The book offered many beautiful color photographs, and the pages themselves were glossy and thick...not the cheaper paper that many cookbooks use.  All of the nutrient information was included, along with a column called "Nutrient Bonus" that lets you know if the dish contained a lot of Vitamin C, Calcium, etc.  The book was hard cover, but the binding was loose enough that my copy easily lays flat, another good bonus so that I was not always struggling to keep my page open.  It also contains a rather large vegetarian section.

Some of our favorites include: Seafood Salad with Citrus Vinaigrette, Bistro Beef Salad, Vietnamese Style Beef A Noodle Broth, Mock Risotto, Chicken Stuffed with Golden Onions A Fontina, Almond Crusted Chicken Fingers, Beer-Battered Tilapia with Mango Salsa, and Loaded Twice Baked Potatoes.  Enjoy!
