This was a childhood favorite of mine which I frequently read in the Library of the Troy Jewish Community Center 87 First Street. 
I can remember sitting there and reading about such questionable greats as Harry Danning, Sid Gordon and Moe Berg. Of course there were undoubted greats like Hank Greenberg and Sid Luckman. And there was in boxing too Barney Ross and Benny Leonard. 
Perhaps there are more up- to- date books about Jews in sports but I doubt there are any which tell a story as well, and give the young person such a warm feeling about the Jewish contribution to what seemed at that time of life, the most important form of human activity.
