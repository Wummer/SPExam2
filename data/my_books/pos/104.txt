Aquot;IAquot; is for I think you would like this book if you read it.  It was a little bit wordy at the beginnig but each page gets better than the one before.  You will be glad you got past the first few pages because it gets a lot more interesting as you go along.  And the ending of this book is really something else, it makes the whole book well worth reading.  I really liked the book and I think you will too
