This is a sci-fi novel about the end of the world.  Every single adult on the planet died.  THere are a couple of kids living in a house alone.  So begins the Fire-Us trilogy, fascinating, scary, and intriguing.

The story is really interesting - I mean slap in your face, give-me-more, I LOVE THIS intersting.  A couple of the images were really disturbing, though, like the fact that Hunter had to move the skeletons out of his way at the supermarket.  The kids in the story are fascinating, and the Teacher's scarpbook-thing was so . . . wierd that it was actually kind of scary.

Then Angerman is introduced.  He's really messed up, but I get the idea that he knows something about the virus (Fire-us) that the others don't.  This makes him an amazing character, and even if you don't like the story its worth reading the sequel just to find out what happens to him and his battered dummy.

I really love this series, though some of the descriptions might be a little too much for younger readers.  Well worth anyone who is into sci-fi and apocalypse, as I was at the time.



P.S. I read this book five months ago and I still remember all of the characters and their names and quirks.  Talk about powerful writing
