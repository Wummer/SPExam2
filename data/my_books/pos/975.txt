This is probably the single best work I've ever seen on the Aquot;scienceAquot; of packing. Joe Back lived and worked in N.W. Wyoming, and was a legend in the area. His humorous annecdotes, and extremely accurate hand drawn diagrams, combined with his obvious knowledge of the subject, make this a Aquot;must haveAquot; for anyone seriously interested in learning how to pack horses or mules, and survive. This little work deserves a place in any packer's library
