Edward Gorey uses gothic illustrations to tell the tale of a strange creature who appears one day in a family's home.  The prose is an amusing rhyme which describes the family's confusion and frustration at dealing  with this unwanted guest.  Although the illustrations are gothic and dark,  the reader is still amused by the creature and the family who must deal  with it
