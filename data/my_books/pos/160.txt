This is a must read for EVERY woman married or single who desires to have a better relationship with the men in their lives.  We all have men in our lives husband, father, brother, son, friend or coworker with whom the relationship is worth improving.  

Keep in mind this is neither a marriage book nor a psychology book.  It is a book about men written for the women who truly care about them and the relationships they have with men.  There is a companion book written about women for men appropriately titled, "For Men Only."  Perhaps those who were offended by this book should give that one a try.

I found this book to be both touching and challenging.  Very Good book!!!
