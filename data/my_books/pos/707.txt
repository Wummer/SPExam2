I was recently diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis, and I started following the nutritional suggestions in this book. I think it's already starting to help! Plus it tells you how to perform strengthening exercises for your aching joints. I am a big fan of Dr. Nelson's other works. I like how she explains the science and the applications. I plan to share this with my mom, who also has osteoarthritis
