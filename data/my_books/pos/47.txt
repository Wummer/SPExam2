This book was wonderful.  The rich grandeur of the south is alive in this story of unimaginable dedication and love.  This book had me teared up more than a few times.  

Kobe Bryant bought his wife a million dollar ring, Noah simply wrote a notebook and read from it.  Read this book and you will know why True Love cannot be bought, duplicated, or imitated with money.
