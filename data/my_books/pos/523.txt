This story, set early in the Aquot;Known SpaceAquot; period, is an important part of Larry Niven's future universe, full of his accustomed ingenuity in both the plots and the science. The Protectors don't fit quite comfortably into the Aquot;Known SpaceAquot; Universe, and have raised some problems later, for example in the famous Aquot;Man-Kzin Wars,Aquot; where the Aquot;Known SpaceAquot; universe has been shared by other writers, including Poul Anderson, Jerry Pournelle, SM Stirling and Hal Colebatch, but the story is fine space opera and entertainment, and has a genuine sense of strangeness and wonder that all too often is lacking from contemporary SF
