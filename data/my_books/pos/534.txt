Michael Farquhar has created another bathroom book for the history-loving set.  This one, Treasury of Deception, is just what it's title implies and is broken down into categories and ranges from prison escapes to scientific frauds, from practical jokes to deadly hoaxes, such as the blood libel.  It is a truly odd mixed bag and should be read over a long period in many small bites, although that may prove harder to do than anticipated and one may find oneself gobbling the whole thing down at once.  The book is light at the right moments and more serious when required and, amazingly enough, never veers into the truly silly, which is a blessing
