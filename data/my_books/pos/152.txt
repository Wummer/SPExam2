With over 1000 recipes, this cookbook is going to take some time to truly put through it's paces, but I've had great results with the few dishes I've tried so far.  The Turkey Wraps with Chipotle Mayo rocked, with a gem of a condiment included - pickled red onion.  I'd use that on any sandwich, anytime.  The sauces for Halibut with Spicy Asian Vinaigrette (really a sambal vinaigrette) and Wasabi Cream were awesome.  Veggie dishes like Asparagus with Shallot and sesame seeds add a special touch to everyday dinners.  

Granted, I haven't even put a dent in the vast amount of dishes represented in this massive cookbook - but so far so good!  I picked this up a few months agao as a remainder and paid about 10.00 for it - about a penny a recipe!  What a deal
