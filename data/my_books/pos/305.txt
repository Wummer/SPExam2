The late Ed McBain left all mystery buffs a lasting legacy with his 87th Precinct novels but a worthy addition to this legacy is The Gutter And The Grave. Written in 1958, this hardboiled gem has been all but forgotten. But thanks to Hard Case Crime, a new generation can experience this incredible early work from one of the all-time masters. 

The hero, Cordell, is as tragic and harboiled as they come as he, soaked in cheap booze, wallows in the memory of an unfaithful wife. Until a favor for a friend draws him into a web of murder and deception. It seems everyone is lying and each lie twists the tail in new directions, leaving the reader's head spinning. The novel features McBain's usually excellent dialogue, the setting is well-drawn featuring the jazz scene in 1950's New York. There's humor, pathos, some great fights and enough broken dreams to fill Broadway. 

This little gem of a novel has been unavailable for far too long. I give it my highest recommendation. Fantastic!
