Although not as fascinating as his PAPER CRYSTALS (a stellar work of modular origami), MATHEMATICAL ORIGAMI is a very solid work on the topic.  David Mitchell again gives clear instructions in text and diagrams for a very intriguing branch of paperfolding.  There are many books on geometric and modular origami, but Mitchell's are more than just "look at this neat design."  Instead, they are well thought out and very intelligently written.  A must-have for fans of the art
