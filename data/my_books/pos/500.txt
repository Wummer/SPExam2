This is a very handy little book to have for your medical library. It is easy to follow, has a nice index to look up your particular problem and doesn't bog the reader down with a huge history and medical jargon of accupressure. 
It has easy to use pictures too.
I have used it already to help my annoying neck and shoulder pain!  Sure beats a $50.00 office visit (and most likely, a 3rd or 4th) to your doctor :
