This book is the best book on Rand's esthetics I've ever read; in fact, it is the only book on the topic that I know of.  It is refreshing to see that the authors are objective and critical; they are not slavish cultists  savoring every last word written by Rand.  They approach the material with  critical distance and do an excellent job of placing Rand's work in the  larger history of esthetic theory.  They demolish abstract art, and devote  considerable energy to discussing Rand's definition of art.  They even  propose their own individual alternatives!   If anything shows  independence, it is this willingness to debate the differences between the  authors of the same work!  Remarkable!  The world of Rand commentary is  filled to the brim with sectarianism and partisanship.  That is clear just  by reading one of the reviews here, by people who are devotees of certain  Aquot;scholarsAquot; who do nothing but repeat the catechism.  They take  swipes at genuinely independent work anytime it is published; that is why  they hate this book.  Because it is independent-minded.  Judge for  yourself.  Don't be fooled
