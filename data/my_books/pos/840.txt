I would strongly recommend that anyone interested in this book read the review of this book by M. Goldin on H- Net.It is comprehensive and comes from someone who served in an Armed Forces combat unit during the Second World War.
This book chronicles the negative and prejudiced attitudes held by various figures of the Army throughout the past century. 
These attitudes may have been  important in effecting the lives of individual soldiers at the unit level.
They too may have had certain effect on overall U.S. policy in such matters as bombing the rail lines into Auschwitz. 
There were also efforts to influence negatively American attitudes towards the emerging Jewish state in Israel. 
This is in a way a sad and yet important book to read. It chronicles how that fundamental American ideal of equal treatment of the individual human being was violated by prejudice, and ignorance.
