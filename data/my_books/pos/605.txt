This is a must read book.  Not just once, but many times.  Each time you read it you understand and see a different view of the book.  One needs to read this book from the Heart as the meaning of Kokoro means from the Heart.  The story of a married man, yet lonely.  Why he feels guilty about the death of his best friend.  A scholar with no ambition, rich enough to enjoy a few simple things in life.  How he talks about the ending of his own life. He is sure his wife will be taken care of after his death.  The student is confused. I am confused.  Read the book more than once.  Each time you read, put yourself in each characters "shoe".  Written with passion, Kokoro, from the Heart. Is this book fiction or non-fiction, you decide
