Not great, maybe, but good. 

The theme is vampire - the creatures that feed by night on their human cattle. But what if the night goes on and on?

Good suspense, good characters and development, and an artistic style that carries the mood. It's a nightmarish visual style and a limited palette (black, white, and blood red), but it works. Recommended.
