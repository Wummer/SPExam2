I'm generally into non-fiction and new to Nora Roberts, but I enjoyed "Northen Lights" very much. The book is well crafted with a believable plot and a group of quirky likeable charcters. I was sorry to finish the book and found myself wanting to vist "Lunacy Alaska" again. Final test was I ordered and sent the book to a dear very literate friend; she enjoyed it as much as I did
