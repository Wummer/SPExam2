Wow..I LOVE this book! The recipes are creative and the presentations beautiful. I love the simplicity of each recipe, which give the warmth and richness of traditional old fashioned taste with a twist of the class Aamp; sophistication of today's refined culinary experience!  Sara's food philosophy and the atmosphere she has created in her market has been my dream. I'm living it through her cookbook right now
