Loved this book.  I think that this is a must-read for anybody working in a shelter or rescue situation.  The only negative comment is that the people who really need to read the book are not going to read it.  Working in the field, we see first-hand the changes that need to be made in our thoughts on animals. I wish that reading this book could be required before obtaining any animal. I will say that I cried during parts of the book
