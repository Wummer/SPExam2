I've read this book four times through the years since I first bought it.  The love between the two main characters, though a forbidden love, is so beautiful and magical it made me cry for Meggy and Father Ralph.

Not only is this an unforgettable love story, it's also a great education about sheep farming in Australia.  Magnificent description of a then harsh land.  The dialogue is believable, the characters so very real ...  I didn't simply read this book, I experienced it.  When the characters laughed, I laughed, and when they cried, my heart broke for them.

Poor little Meggy ... poor father Ralph.  How bittersweet and memorable.

I really can't get over the quality of this book and the sensitivity of the author.
