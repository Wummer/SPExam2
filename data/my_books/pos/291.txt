My pick for the finest book of 2005. (Ok Smith's on beauty is up there too) We know from page one that we are  in the hands of a master craftsmen! Reading Ian McGawen is like watching a great pitching performance. It might be slower paced than you'd like but God is it beautiful.
   Fraught with elegance and grace "Saturday" is a great read and the work of a true literary giant. I highly reccomend this book.
