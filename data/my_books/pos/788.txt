Exposure to Harv Eker's Millionaire Mind Intensive set me on a path of working towards financial freedom over two years ago.  I also attended the Guerilla Business School, a $2500 intensive.

  What is important to realize is that actually being in a room in the workshops and doing it several days in a row will actually (as it did with me) shift your perspective, if you are at all open to having it shifted.  

  Getting into a better mindset with regards to prosperity is fundamentally an issue of breaking down old programs and replacing them with new ones.

  This book may help you, but the seminar will help you more.

  The Millionaire Mind intensive taught me things and set in motion a change in perpective for me.   I am now financially free and well on my way to be wealthy as an internet marketer promoting a website called ZeroDollarMarketer dot com.  

  Being rich is a matter of perspective.  True wealth is measured for me by the health of my body and mind, my relationships, and lastly my pocketbook.  But its sure good to have plenty left over at the end of the month.

  A journey worth pursuing
