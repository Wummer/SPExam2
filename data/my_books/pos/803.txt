This book explains in simple terms all the stuff that the other one's don't explain. It's one of the best books on photography hands down.
It's clearly the next step in amature photography you will need.I am currently waiting for it to arrive at my door. I have read it already.
I want to own it so I have it forever. I plain on absorbing every comma, period and explaination mark, and explaining it to everyone.
My hat's off to the author. I LIKE IT
