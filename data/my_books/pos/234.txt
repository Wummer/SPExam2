I recommend that most people do NOT read this book.  If you choose to ignore me and you read the work anyway, please first be remotely acquainted with and keep in mind a few things before you attempt to do so (and certainly before you try to express an ostensibly reputable opinion on Amazon): **magical realism**; Jewish history, religion, culture and humor(although the last is perhaps redundant); memory; folk lore; the English language; love; the nature of histories; sex; death; pain; narrative style and voice; the multiplicity of human, and likewise Jewish, experience; imagination.  I will assert, because I hope it is true, that you don't need to all of these things to enjoy "Illuminated," but you do need to be familiar with some of it.  And you must be willing to spend some time with this book to enjoy it.  All those with self-diagnosed A.D.D. need not bother cracking the spine. However, even if you qualify despite the rigor of what may be required of you, everything may be indeed sadly "obfuscated."  Or perhaps less disappointingly, only partly obfuscated.  If so, don't get angry. Don't curse the gods or creative writing programs. And certainly, if you are going to write bad reviews on Amazon, preface it first with your own faults as a reader. Lastly, buck up.  Read another book.  Even the Bible (another little book high up on the best seller's list) is not for everyone.

And for those of you out there who disagree to my approach with this review of "Illuminated", that is fine.  Dismiss it.  At least, please don't take the advice of any other critic here who speaks in an equally perturbed voice.  Moreover, don't read it for the reviews...Actually stop reading reviews. Now
