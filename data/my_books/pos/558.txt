to surmise, the book is about an actor who is hired to be a political figure. 
I will not reveal any more as to not ruin the nature of the plot.
I felt that like some of heinlein's books, the book is plauged with 
politics, less science fiction, the only sci-fi thing about it is that the plot takes place in space, other than that, it's all politics.
Same thing with Citizen of the galaxy, a book that starts off really well and ending with a theme that do not portray sci-fi rather it shows heinlein's knowledge in law. 
I felt that the book could have been much better and i don't see how it won the Hugo award.
Conclusion: The book is a fun pass, but nothing more. don't expect any groundbreaking plot, or jaw dropping plot twists, just your old fashioned politicians-dear-diary
