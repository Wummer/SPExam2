Good, high-level analysis of current US vs European international relations written from a conservative perspective.   As with any book covering fluid world events this book can only provide a snapshot, circa 2000-04, of those events.  But there are two significant underlying assumption in this book: 

First, as the single greatest world power, the US will project its power for decades in any region of the world it feels has long-term impact to its strategic goals, such as Europe throughout the entire Cold War, Southeast Asia in the 60's A 70's and in the Middle East today.  

Second, US historically has viewed itself as the proponent of the spread of liberal democracy through out the world.  

Rather than focusing on the snipping back and forth between the US A Europe, the two major assumptions of this book could serve as a litmus test to observe how current US foreign policy in the Middle East plays itself out over the next few decades.  Is it merely a current political view or a historic shift in strategic focus to a different region of the world? Stay tuned.

It is a well-written, quick read with meaningful subcontextual insights.
