The patterns in this book are really interesting.  They range from everything to cabled belts to baby booties to light sweaters.  This isn't as informative as the original "Stitch 'n Bitch" book, but if you have mastered the basics, it is a good starting point for ideas.  Plus, it has tried and true tips and tricks from knitters accross the nation.
