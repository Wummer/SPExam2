This Bible dictionary is a one volume source for nearly everything associated with or found in the Bible.  It covers the Bible cover to cover with personalities, places, themes, concepts, etc.  Anyone who needs a resource for Bible studies or just for general knowledge will want to own this book.  Church libraries should have it available for library users. This is an excellent resource.

The editors chose authors who can write succinctly and clearly when they write on their subjects.  Readers will appreciate the thoroughness as well as the readability of this book.
