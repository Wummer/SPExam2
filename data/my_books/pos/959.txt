I loved this book!   I picked it up on a whim at the airport, and couldn't put it down for the entire flight. Now I'm telling all my friends to get it.  Not only does it have tips about playing cards, but it's just a flatout pageturning thriller.  You keep wondering where this guy's life is going to lead him next.  Very suspenseful and funny too.  Highly recommended.
