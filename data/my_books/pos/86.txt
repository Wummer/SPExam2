Briggs has perfected the art of the wordless book, and this is a great title to use to teach older kids how to do storyboarding for video or movie-making. Compare the book to the video as a final "lesson" and students will see the intricacies of the craft. This newly reissued edition has a "sparkly" cover, and is sure to be a favorite for families with kids of all ages, as well.
