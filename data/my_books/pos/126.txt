Currently, educational studies are being revealed, which are showing that students of minority heritage (particularly Black and Latino) have an affinity towards InterPersonal learning and Tactile learning

Interpersonal = learning through being social and group work

Tactile = learning by building or constructing things

Our current educational institutions, especially high school and below, cater to Auditory (hearing) and Intrapersonal (introverted, little group work) learners

So in total, poverty and language barriers are likely not the biggest culprit towards our low school scores, in areas of economic problems ----- rather, it is the fact that teachers are not teaching to the strengths of our children - as a matter of fact, most children are being taught within the areas of their learning weaknesses

With that in mind, FRAMES OF MIND is one of the first books to distiguish the way we learn and how to cater to it

Within this book lies the best solutions to our educational system, and its only a matter of getting the teachers to facilitate their lesson plans differently

I highly recommend this book - especially to those who are interested in seeing what the future of America is all abou
