Okay, the title is a bit much.  But I enjoyed this book tremendously.  Some of the criticisms point to the elements I liked best.  The routine cases, how they were approached, and the results were a revelation to someone who has no real idea of police work except what I've seen on "Cops" (constant action and crisis!).  There was a new story on every page, and I wound up reading until 1 a.m. on a work day because I just couldn't help reading "one more page".  The descriptions of the surroundings, the characters, the sounds and smells of the settings, conjured up a real sense of being there.  I was fascinated by the character faults and virtues of the people in the book, as Atkinson tried to remain true to McCain's philosophy that most people aren't entirely good or bad.  As a resident of the area, I finally understand the gang wars that were taking place when I was growing up (I remember the old Boston Record American newpaper with the crime scene photos splashed across the front).  I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who lives in the Northeast, and to others who'd like a glimpse into how Boston politics are practiced in every profession
