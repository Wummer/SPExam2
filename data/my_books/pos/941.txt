While some may think that good work should be "readable and enjoyable,"  great work is meant to elevate us. Stun us, amaze us, fill us with wonder.  Otherwise, See Spot Run would be a masterpiece.  

William Faulkner is a writer the likes of which we may never see again.  He is not only brilliant of word but of concept.  He creates a picture not only by text, but by context and form.  In many ways, his works sculpt.  How else would we see things from the vistas of the characters, especially those who can't speak but by setting and demonstration?

One reviewer cursed his conveyance of emotion by "using big words."  Writing is the art of language interplay, the use of beautiful and succinct language.  Faulkner uses language that most of us have never heard of but when we take the time to look up that language, the effect is stunning and makes the experience all the more worth it.
