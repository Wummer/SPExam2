I wish I had put some kind of protection on my Transits by Hand. I did not buy the hardback and usage of the paperback over the years by me and my daughter has managed to deteriorate the 2 or 3 copies I've had to reorder!  I always read other books about transiting planets and their influence, but for the final touch I always resort to the master himself, Robert Hand.  I was lucky enough to hear a few of his tapes and he is absolutely fascinating to listen to; has a delightful sense of humor (Sagittarius influence), is a supreme story-teller, which makes it impossible not to learn as you listen.  A lot of hard work must have gone into this work.  If anyone is to break the barriers between astrology and scientific worlds, Hand would be the one to lead the onslaught!  No astrologer or anyone learning astrology could do without this book
