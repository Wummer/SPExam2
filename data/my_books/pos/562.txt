I like most of Jack Kornfield's work and this book is no exception.  It has a lot of good stories that are very entertaining and each of them illuminates important spiritual truths.  The focus of this book is on misconceptions about enlightenment and samdhi experiences.  Also, it contains some beautiful accounts of samdhi experiences taken from various religious traditions.  

There is a lot of practical wisdom in this book about finding meaning on the spiritual path and in life in general.  Jack Kornfield dispels the illusion we are ever a finished product or that our various personality quirks will ever disappear completely.  In one section, he quotes Ram Dass who once was asked, did you get rid of all your personality problems and he replied, "no.. but I've become a connoisseur of my neurosis."  

In another section, Jack talks about vocation or purpose in life.  I found this to be particularly well done and personally meaningful.  While the book is good, I think you may get more out of the audio CD because you get to hear the tone of his voice and inflections.  I think this carries a part of the communication that doesn't come across in his books.

My favorite taped work by Jack Kornfield is your Buddha Nature.  This is on the 10 paramitas (perfections) and I think it represents his most poignant expression of his thinking on life.  If you like After the Ecstasy, the Laundry... you may want to consider purchasing this as well
