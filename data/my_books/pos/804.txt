Geez.  Its a book folks.  Nobody said it was going to be perfect.  Granted the sentence structure leaves alot to be deisred but use your imagination.  Draw upon your inner child and immerse yourself in the story and stop worrying about the piddly things.  If you want to read books then read them and enjoy them.  If you want to EDIT them then go be an editor.  We live in a world where people sell drugs that kill our kids for money and your worried about this guy making a few bucks with a writing career?  It's called priorities people, get some.  I say he should continue to write and see what he becomes.  

I have read Tolkien (not just The Hobbit and LOTR - but ALL of his works).  Dark Tower, Harry Potter, and Star Wars stuff too.  I love Sci-Fi.  Stop nitpicking.  If your at that point then you have lost the purpose of picking up a good sci-fi book.  Start over.  Do not pass go and do not collect $200.00.
