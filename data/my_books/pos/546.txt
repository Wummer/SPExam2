Once again, Jasper Fforde has created a story that is brilliantly written, perfectly blending English literature with wit.

The book continues the story of Thursday Next by creating a new conflict, as well as making connections with the previous Thursday Next novels, adding a deeper level to the reading.

Highly recommended reading, but I also recommend you read the series in order
