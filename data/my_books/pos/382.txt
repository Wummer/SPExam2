I lived in a situation somewhat like that Richardson describes.  We watched VietNam from 1000 miles away, but the players were the same.  It was like living at the far edge of the Welsh Marches in the time of the Roman Empire.  Maybe if you haven't lived within a bureauocracy you won't understand, but everything he says is true
