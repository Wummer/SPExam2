This story gives me hope in mankind again.  Despite the horrendous abuse, this woman gave herself -- all of herself -- to save a child from the torment she experienced.  I wish there were more people like Torey Hayden in this world.  I can only hope that I can touch lives in the way Ms. Hayden has.  This book will open eyes to the terrors of abuse that does, indeed, occur in this world, despite the fact that we would like to close our eyes to it.  It also demonstrates the hope that victims can overcome and the need for us to step up to the plate to end this war of terror
