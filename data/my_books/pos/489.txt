Tapscott and Ticoll have written another very detailed, practical and profound book about business that shows their knack for zeroing in on the heart of a momentous change that is stirring in the world and explaining it all clearly and completely.  At the heart of The Naked Corporation is the notion that shareholders and other stakeholders are empowered by technology to know more and more about organizations faster and faster, which in turn greatly emboldens them to take action based on their new knowledge.  In other words, perhaps the old adage "there's one born every minute" needs updating.  They're still being born, but hopefully now only a few per hour?  Corporations "getting naked" can't be good news for marketing departments.  Their job can no longer be about creating a nice rosy image; companies and products must be the image - for real.
