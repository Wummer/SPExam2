I thought that the two books previous to this in the Duncan Kincaid/Gemma James series were slight disappointments.  Kincaid seemed relegated to a side character with Gemma taking the lead.  IN A DARK HOUSE is an excellent mystery that brings the two back to equal ground and re-establishes them as one of the best partnerships in mystery fiction
