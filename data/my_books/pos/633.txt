Just when you thought you've heard all Larry has to offer...  it gets WAY better...   I've only just started reading it the past 2 days, but I have to say it..  I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE THAT'S FUNY RIGHT THERE!!!!!   

He's got hte downhome Good Ole Boy humor mixed 9at least i see it that way) with a good interpretation of how ALL "blue coller" working class people are.    I may be a yankee.. but I'm from the great city of PITTSBURGH PENNSYLVANIA.....  AND WE LIVE AND THRIVE ON GOOD OLE AMERICAN LIVING.   Funny how Redneck verbage and Pittsburghese IS errily SIMILAR.  Makes me PROUD to wave, wear and salute the red white and blue
