This is the best baseball book ever!  Not only is it beautifully organized and rich with facts, but it's so well written! As someone who came late to baseball, I find the book hard to put down.  IF you can only buy one baseball book, this is it--it's a major reference for any fan, and it's going to make a great holiday gift too.  Get your copy before they're all gone
