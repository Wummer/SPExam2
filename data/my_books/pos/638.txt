It's been a while since I've read one of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum novels, but a sudden need for light reading found Ten Big Ones at the book store.  Plum's biggest worries tend to be about whether she is lusting after Joe Morelli or Ranger, how to get the latest bond jumper down to the police station, and how she is going to replace whatever vehicle just got destroyed.  Definitely light fare, even if her current problem is how to avoid death identifying the thief in a grocery store heist and then turning the local gang leader into a careening pinball in traffic. He not only wants Stephanie dead, but he also wants her end to be spectacular.

Stephanie's response is to break up with her steady boyfriend, Joe Morelli, again, gorge on jelly donuts, and go into hiding at one of Ranger's lairs.  Of course, this doesn't work as well as it should because even Ranger's soap is too sexy for words.  And Stephanie, glutton for punishment that she is, she has to go out and make sure everyone knows that she is trying to keep a low profile.  So, you see, this is standard Stephanie Plum fare - lighthearted mayhem and a heroine who is half macho and half wuss, usually with bad timing.

My issue with Evanovich's books isn't with any particular one, but with what happens if you read too many at one time.  Stephanie's biggest problem is herself - a decided lack of common sense.  Which is what you would expect from someone who works as a bounty hunter, but leaves her gun in the cookie jar.  In four hundred pages this is funny, but if you've been reading a lot in a row, the steady diet of vaudeville sight gags is d\ufffdj\ufffd vu all over again.  After a break of a year or so this goes away and I found Ten Big Ones a pleasure to read.  It introduces a whole ne order of plot complication and one of the more remarkable bus drivers in literary history.  By all means, if you need a break from the weight of the world, take the time to read this.
