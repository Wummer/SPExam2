i couldn't help myself when i opened the juicing bible--i should have been doing other things--but i spent over an hour perusing the pages.  it contains a wealth of information on fruits, herbs, and vegetables and their healing properties.  the layout is handy and it is easy to find things with the detailed indices.  the recipes are simple, clearly written, and sound delicious.  i am excited and inspired.  in fact, i'm going to get my juicer off of the bottom shelf of the pantry and go for it
