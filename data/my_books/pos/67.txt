A good and clear illustrated guide to exercises with both machines and free weights. Also the best methods for each body type outlined. You even get sample workouts for people at all levels of fitness and exercise development.

The book shows exercises for each body part so you can develop your own routine and it also includes a log you can copy.

The book includes routines for seniors and weight loss. There are some 300 color photos and you'll learn how to do each exercise and what to avoid that may cause injury.

A good book for anyone at any level of fitness who needs a complete, handy guide. Being spiral bound it will go with you and you can easily use it daily.

My one complaint is that some of the routines are devoted to using machines only and many people don't belong to a gym but work out at home. For them, this creates a real problem
