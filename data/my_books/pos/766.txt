When considering the faith of the founders of the U.S, it is easy to rely on half-truths and assumptions.  David Holmes dispels a lot of myths in his well-researched book which uses historical documentation, personal letters, and observations of conduct in order to describe the various beliefs which the early patriots espoused.  He begins by describing the religious movements of the 18th. century which influenced our founders.  One interesting point he makes is that 9 of the original colonies had government-sponsored churches, a practice which the country quickly abandoned when the colonies united into a nation.  Although many of the people he describes, including George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson, were brought up in orthodox Christian churches, such as Episcopal and Congregational, they were later influenced by the Deist movement which opposed many orthodox Christian views.  He describes some interesting practices, such as the fact that George Washington would leave Anglican services before participating in communion, despite the fact that his wife Martha would stay for the sacrament.  This is only one example of an early political wife who stayed true to her orthodox upbringing despite the Deist leanings of her husband.  Holmes concludes his book with a brief description of modern-day presidents and their religious beliefs which bear much more scrutiny than the founding fathers' did.  In writing this book Holmes displays an impartiality which is fitting for an historian, and which makes it all the more believable
