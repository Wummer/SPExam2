I REALLY enjoyed this book.  I thought the movie incorporated most of the good parts in the book.  There were some character changes and some additional characters in the book, but I don't think they hurt the story line by trimming here and there.  I read the book after seeing the movie - I always wondered what the movie had been based on.  I love baseball, and I think the book was great
