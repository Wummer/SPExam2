As an econ student at UC Davis, I have learned to appreciate books that explain concepts concisely and in an easily understandable way.  This is one of those few.  Chapters are relatively short and are uncluttered with unnecessary examples or tangents.  Graphs are labeled with simple explanations that are useful for clarification as well as quick-reference.  
I recommend this book to people who want to understand econ without trudging through the swamp of repetition, needless technicality, and headache
