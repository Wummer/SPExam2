McNeill calls American Indians and Africans little more than the victims of the West in this book. He explains that they have little role in the development of culture (which he sees as passing from society to society from Mesopotamia on, like some sort of conceptual Olympic torch) and some get it and others do not. It is an outdated and bigoted way to see cultural history, and difficult to read without cringing. 

That said, the book contains marvelous elements. Few writers will explain with his brevity and mastery how cultures have passed elements, one to another, over the expanse of time; few writers can convey the forward momentum of history as McNeil. So with all its faults, it is very worthy book, certainly worth reading while keeping in minds its somewhat dramatic shortcomings
