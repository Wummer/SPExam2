Hal Zina Bennett's profound advice from his prolific writing career (over 30 published books) is, Aquot;write from the heartAquot;.  As wonderful as that sounds, most writers know it's not an easy thing to do.  	Hal takes us to another dimension by sharing his personal process and showing each of us how we can remove the blocks to our expression and creativity by learning how to speak from our heart to the heart of our reader. I can speak from my own personal experience, having attended his workshops and received personal counselling from him in the process of writing my book, Aquot;Sacred Woman, Sacred Dance:  Awakening Spirituality Through Movement and RitualAquot;. 	Aquot;Write From the HeartAquot; also offers practical guidance in several areas.  This includes such things as the need for solitude.  However, he is not just talking about having Aquot;a quiet spaceAquot;, he goes beyond the physical to the inner - a state of mind.  He says, Aquot;Once we know what it is, what it looks like and feels like, we can create it for ourselves, almost--I say Aquot;almostAquot;--regardless of where we happen to be.Aquot;  	I would certainly recommend this book to anyone writing for personal expression or looking to be published
