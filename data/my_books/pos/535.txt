This was an amazing book.  It was one of those where when you read it, you can picture the story in your head, almost movie like.  Feist did an amazing job with descriptions and character developement.  This was my first Fiest book, but I can guarantee you, it wont be my last.

The plot follows a young boy named Kieli and his story of becoming a spy and weapon against those that murdered his village. The story begins with Kieli on a vision quest, a test to prove he is ready to be an adult.  He must go to a sacred hill and wait for a vision to appear to him.  He then finds that his village has been attacked and that he is the sole remainer of his people.  The story goes on to tell of his quest for vengance and his plot of revenge.

Amazing in every way
