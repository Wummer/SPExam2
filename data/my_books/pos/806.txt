After reading this account of the acension of Everest, you gotta wonder why anybody would want to.
Is it really worth it ?
For the thrill seaking personality, of course it is.
For normal people, forget about it.
Even if you aren't into climbing mountains, this book is gripping from page to page and you don't want to put it down.
Krakauer's first (?) book - "Into the Wild" is also great but this one is better, being a first person account.
I remember when this came out and the surrounding backlash that accompanied it from people associated to the dead.
Forget them, Krakauer get's it right, with no hidden agenda, unless you count surviving.
I would have liked more commentary from the surviving members, though.
And not to state the obvious to everyone else but me but why do they leave the bodies on the mountain ?
They risk their lives to rescue the affirmed or injured living but once they're dead, they just leave them there ?
What's up with that ?
