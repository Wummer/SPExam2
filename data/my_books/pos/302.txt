Nora's "In The Garden" Trilogy was great, but I must say not her best.  Her characters are so life-like and you actually feel like you're part of the story.  She's a phenomenal author and I have not come across anything of hers that I have not thoroughly enjoyed.  
I also highly recommend "The Three Sisters Island Trilogy."  By far my favorite.

Happy Reading!
