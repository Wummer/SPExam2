..."First Grade Takes a TestA#8221; is an excellent, multicultural book that should be in every elementary classroom, especially Kindergarten thru 3rd grades...For itA#8217;s use in demonstrating that the really important things in life arenA#8217;t measurable, and even as a tool for helping students understand and interpret poorly worded questions (and there will always be a handful of them on any standardized test), the book is invaluable.  Highly recommended from this early childhood teacher
