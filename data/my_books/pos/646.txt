This is *da book* on Aquot;The Dick Van Dyke ShowAquot;, but it's really far more than that.  It is the finest book on a TV sitcom I've ever come across.  Waldron painstakingly discusses everything you'd ever want to know  about  the show, and he interviewed (seemingly) everyone connected with the  show, including Carl Reiner, Mary Tyler Moore, Dick, Larry Matthews, Rose  Marie, and many of the writers. If you're a DVDS fan, you've gottta have  this tome on hand.  I can't recommend it  highly enough.  I fervently hope  Vince will do subsequent books on Aquot;CheersAquot; and other  sitcoms...he's the ONLY man for the job
