When I saw the cover of this book, I had a feeling I would love it. The picture of the little boy on the cover flexing his muscles is something I have seen my three sons do many, many times. When I opened it and started to read, wonderful memories flooded back of when my sons were younger. I laughed and cried almost simultaneously while reading several of the stories. 

If you have sons, or have friends that have sons, this book is a must. I will be buying my friends who are mothers of sons this for Christmas
