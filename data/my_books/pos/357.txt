I LOVE Joanna Brady!  However, this introduction to her and her life in Bisbee is NOT the best book Jance has ever written.  One thing that is terrific about Jance, though, is that she is from Bisbee and describes the town in exact detail.  Bisbee is a quaint crazy town and Jance grabs all of the details of that small town oasis in the desert.  Joanna Brady is a likeable character and the series gets beter and better as time goes by. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!
