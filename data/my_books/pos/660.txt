This is an excellent book examining how and why some people come to believe that they have suffered appalling abuse that most probably never happened. It DOES NOT deny the reality of or harm caused by sexual abuse (the author explicitly states this on many occasions) and the reviewer who suggested that this is "a terrific book if you are child molester" probably (I guess) didn't bother reading it and made up the especially foul accusation to prevent others from examining the issues surrounding repressed memory and the cult of therapy.
The author shows how even trained professionals can disregard overwhelming evidence against a particular hypothesis (repressed memory/MPD/satanic cults) and rely on their intuition to (unintentionally) wreak havoc with their clients lives. In the upside-down world of some therapists, lack of hard evidence is trumped by strength of feeling for even the most outrageous accusation. Pendergrast demonstrates how uncertain and malleable human memory can be.
The book is written in an easy style and despite what another particularly stupid review suggests, concentrates specifically on the scientific evidence for his claims
