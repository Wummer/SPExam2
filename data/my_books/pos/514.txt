Since so many others have outlined the general plot of this story (huge lawsuit against a hospital; suspicious deaths that may or may not have been committed by a doctor) I'll simply leave a brief comment.  Although the story isn't all that complicated, it was still a quick, enjoyable read--and the ending was one I didn't see coming.  Please be aware, though, that THE 5TH HORSEMAN is NOT an Alex Cross novel, which seemed to be one reviewer's complaint.  This is the story of Lindsay Boxer, SFPD Lieutenant and her fellow Women's Murder Club friends.  I found the story to be heartfelt and emotional, full of action-adventure, and, as I said, a very quick, satisfying read
