Harvey Mackay was one of the first authors I had read on how to run a business.  The book is written in an entertaining manner, and contains a great deal of fantastic advice. 

To this day, friends who were around me when I read this book in college will quote parts of it back to me.  

It contains tidbits of guidance, some great, some small.  All good.
