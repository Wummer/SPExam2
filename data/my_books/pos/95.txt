I liked this book because it was quick and easy to read, but also had more in-depth information in the back.  Each month, there is a chart of symptoms to let you know what is important to go to the ER, call your doc, or wait 24 hours to check.  There were great decision guides that presented both sides.  I like that I know a reputable hospital stands behind the book, as well.  I have 6 pregnancy books, but this one is my favorite
