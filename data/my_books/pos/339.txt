This book provides a straight-forward approach to a raw-food diet, and the changes required to maintain the health of your pet through the process.  It also helps to have someone who can assist you in locating the ingredients locally, but Schultze provides all the requisite information that you will need.  A great resource to go to when you get a nagging question, or have a concern.  Try not to let people talk you out of trying the diet, as you WILL see changes in the health of your pet; many veterinarians that I have spoken with are not particularly supportive.  My 2 y/o Lab has a softer coat, clearer eyes, and better muscle tone since I have started him on the diet.  This diet is slightly more expensive than feeding dog chow, but the reward of having a healthy, happy pet far outweigh the associated costs.  Good luck, and enjoy your pet
