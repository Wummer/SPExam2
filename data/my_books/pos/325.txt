A wonderful story of how even our smallest action can have great consequences that we can't even understand.  A long book with fantastic memorable characters.  My favorite of these characters were the two brothers who were fixated on Serial killers and natural disasters.  This is the only way they know how to cope with the outside world.  

Overall-You will certainly get your money's worth.  Enjoy this one.
