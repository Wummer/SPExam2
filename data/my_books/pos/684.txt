In the last few decades historians --following sociologists such as Durkheim-- have turned their attention to the ways in which new technologies have altered people's experience of space and time.  Schivelbusch's small piece is a pretty good (but light-weight) example of  this genre. He reveals some interesting trivia along the way: he tells, for  example, how padded upolstery was invented to assuage the fears of  first-class passengers brought about by the roughness of new speed; he  shows that compartment design in passenger cars reflect the contrasting  social values of Europe and America. But he is at his most interesting when  describing the ways in which the railroad created new conceptual forms of  geographical distance by obliterating the spaces in between destinations.  Furthermore, by creating the need for standardized time-tables, railways  nurtured a standardized/homogenized conception of time. Local  idiocyncracies became less important. Doubtless true national identities  could never have emerged without revolutions in transportation and  communications. A book that takes these ideas much further is Stephen  Kern's excellent work Aquot;The Culture of Time and Space.Aquot; If this  genre interests you, Kern's book is an important read
