If you're an easily offended religious fanatic who's always looking for the vaguest insult or contradiction to your beliefs... I guess you shouldn't read this. (Actually, you could probably read this one and just skip the sequels.)

But if you're anyone else (of any age) who enjoys a really awesome story with great characters, adventure, danger, fantastic visual writing, and not a single boring moment, (well... it might take a little effort to get past the beginning, but that's coming from a really impatient reader) then yeah. Go for it. Because there's just nothing that compares
