Each Planet listed in this book has details on length of day, length of year, species, population, size, climate, terrain, A much more. Each one also has a picture of the planet accompanying it.

There's also a map of the core worlds along with key location / site maps on nearly every listed planet(very cool).

Coruscant has a huge 29-page entry to it. It also has the GM character Dexter Jettster, info on the Jedi Temple, and many more spots on this planet.  Great for many, many adventures.
Alderaan A Corellia get around 7-pages.

There's also a few new species, many new creatures, and a lot of GM characters to throw at Players.

Some starships are also in here, inlcuding : TIE/Ad Defender prototype A E-Wing.

My only complaint is, there AREN'T more of these Planet books out there for this RPG.  WotC could have done a series of Secrets of... books for each system (or something like that.)

   Otherwise, there ARE a lot of things in this book that will make players believe that their characters are in STAR WARS.

So, yes, buy the book! Support this space fantasy RPG
