One of the most interesting books I've ever read!  I could not put this one down.  If all economics books were written this well, everyone would want to be an economist!  The author has a unique perspective on the analysis of data that is very compelling.  He will make you question every "fact" you've ever heard and observe the world around you from a different angle
