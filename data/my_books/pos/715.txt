Design is a difficult process that is often associated more with art than science.  With principles of style, concerns about how design works.

While many wring their hands about this, Alexander breaks the problem down, organizes it and then provides a framework for design that is relatively design neutral.  That is a feat in deed.  

By thinking about how one structures a problem space and the bias that creates -- Alexander give the practioner a powerful tool for setting up the design process and scope.  He then goes on to discuss the design process and he makes important distinctions between concious and unconcious design.  

Notes on Synthesis and Form are the foundation for Alexander's work on design patterns.  This is the must read book before spending time on these other works.

For the practioner, this book provides a powerful and applicable framework for addressing problems in multiple disciplines.
