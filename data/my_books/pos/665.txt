Girl Sleuth is a must-read especially for the over-50 Nancy Drew fan.  Rehak's research is remarkable.  However, on p. 47, Rehak has Mildred Augustine headed west to the University of Iowa from her hometown of Ladora, Iowa.  She would have headed east.  I have been teaching 30 years in the school district that now includes students from the town of Ladora and have my own degree from Iowa.  I've traveled Highway 6 between Ladora and Iowa City many, many times.
