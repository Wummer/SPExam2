Robert Barid's exploration of history's secret connections is brilliant. By integrating hidden and not presented in any other book various facts of sciences, he clearly shows that our ancestors had much deeper understanding of the Reality than most of the modern people. I had a chance to explore many other books by this author available from his page on the World-Mysteries.com and I highly recommend all of them
