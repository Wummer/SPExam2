This book is inspiring!
The coverage is very broad and it can serve as a handbook for graduate students. Even the hardest bits of econometrics are explained in an easy to understand way.
My personal favourites are chapters 16, 17 and 18.
I will definetely buy a hardcover of the next edition of this econometrics masterpiece.
Summing up, it's one of my favourite books.
