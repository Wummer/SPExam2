I really don't understand all the negative reviews about this book.  I found it an easy to read pleasant mystery, with a main character in midlife turmoil I wanted to sympathize with.  J. A. Jance did an excellent job keeping the pace reasonably fast, while not losing the reader with extraneous characters.
