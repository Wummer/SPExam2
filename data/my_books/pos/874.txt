I read this book in less than one week. Normally I spend and average time of a month in finishing a book, but this was one of the Aquot;rareAquot; cases that the reading last until 2 am. Marcus travels to a wild land,  Germania Libera in order to send a gift of the emperor and ends with his  life in hands of a German sorceress. The full novel is filled with action  and historical references, it's worth the money!
