This book is full of useful insights.  I was fortunate to hear Reichheld present this content at a seminar for marketing professionals.  While some reviewers have complained that his approach is overly simplistic, I doubt any of them have actually applied his methodology to their business.  I applied his methodology to my business (direct selling) and had over 6,000 interviews completed to identify promoters, passives and detractors in the businesses of independent distributors.  Consistent with Reichheld's findings, the segments of my business that were growing fastest had more promoters in their respective customer bases and were performing better across a wide range of metrics.  From the detailed findings, we identified best practices that were leveraged across the entire business.  Buy the book.  Have an open mind.  Apply the concepts he has laid out.  If you do, you will walk away with useful ideas to accelerate the growth of your business
