The story of Anne continues with this work and the author stays true to her style, story line and character developement.  This, like the other books in this series, have a rather timeless nature about them and a comforting charm.  The reader, of course, must remember the time they were written and the style and syntax used at that time.  From my own point of view, this is great.  I enjoy this type of writing and certainly enjoy Ms. Montgomery's story telling abilities.  In this work, Anne goes off to Redman College and her adventure continues.  Recommend these books for readers of all ages.  Wish there were more works out there like it.
