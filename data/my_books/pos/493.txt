I have been an information systems professional for several years now and I am happy to see that there is finally a focus on data as the asset it truly is.  If I could put Aquot;certified dataAquot; on the Balance sheet as a separate line item,  I would.  I have been reading your book Aquot;Improving Data Warehouse and Business Information QualityAquot; over the past several weeks and I have this ear-to-ear grin that some peers find disturbing.  (Why does he get so excited about data?)  High Quality Data=success
