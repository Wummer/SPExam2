  I found this to be a real page-turner.  It addressed all the issues leading to the near destruction of the High Plains in the 1930s: agricultural, social, political.  Dealing heavily with first-person accounts, I learned about the Dust Bowl, the depression, and the psychology of the times.  Great book
