This book is a great thing to have for anyone involved in the world of theatre.  It does the hard work of picking out a crucial 16-bar piece of a song for you!  Great for auditions.  The book has selections from musicals (old and new, familiar and rare), as well as movies (even some Disney!).  There's one for every vocal part.  Granted, not every piece is exactly 16 bars.  Some go a bit over, but this is usually excusable due to proper phrasing.  It's well worth looking into for those who are just starting out.  It's also a way of introducing yourself to a variety of musicals
