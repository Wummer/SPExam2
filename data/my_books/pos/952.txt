This was the very first Jonathan Kellerman book I had ever read.  This is by far the best one he ever wrote.  I don't think that I have ever read a book so riveting and suspensful.  It's like watching a top notch horror/mystery movie.  This has got to be my most favorite book of any by anyone.  I still recommend it to people after reading it quite a few years ago now.  I give this book a 5++++ star rating
