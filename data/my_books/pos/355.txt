I love this book!  I love this series and it absolutely pains me to think that this may be the last (I say maybe because originally Buddies was supposed to be the last).  It is such a difficult book to pick up and read because every emotion invested in the previous three books is tested.  My love for Dennis Savage's irony becomes sorrow at the hope that he will lose face and stay with Little Kiwi.  My love for Little Kiwi's innocence becomes concern for his actions.  It's like watching your child make questionable decisions and knowing that no matter what the result, the choices that they make are theirs, and there's nothing you can do about it, but let them be chosen.  It's hard letting Little Kiwi grow up and become Virgil Brown.  I imagine it's the same way with a child, but at least then you get to see what happens!  Mind you, the book like the other three is a comic genius with subtle, feeling humor that has you laughing one minute and crying the next.  But just like Aquot;Just Above My HeadAquot; by James Baldwin (which I highly recommend), I have been unable to pick up this book and read it again.  It simply leaves me realing with so many feelings, yet I would not trade the experience reading it with anything.  How does one mix merriment with malaise so well?  Read the book and find out
