With the release of Jasper Fforde's fourth title in the Thursday Next sci-fi/fantasy series, readers will be treated to the culmination of the alternative Earth that the author has spent three books building. In "Something Rotten," the options for direction for the series are fully realized as the alternate Earth of 1988 and the world of Fiction are completely in place.

When last we left the intrepid Thursday Next, she had just saved the world of Fiction from yet another villain intent on its destruction. Pregnant and with her husband erased from history by the evil Goliath Corporation, Thursday's finally given birth to a son, Friday, who at two year old only speaks in Lorem Ipsum (a good example of the craziness of Fforde's vision.) Deciding that her time overseeing the purity of novels has worn thin, she returns to Earth and winds up becoming:
* The target of an assassin
* The coach of her town's professional croquet team
* The thorn in the side of a hypnotic politician who is actually fictional
* The hostess to Hamlet, Prince of Denmark
* The on-again, off-again wife to her exterminated, unexterminated husband
* The finder of a live clone of William Shakespeare
* The friend of Neanderthals everywhere
* Dead--twice
* The holder of the secrets of the apocalypse
* The once-again savior of the planet

If you think that's about three books in one, well that pegs "Something Rotten." Fforde packs this book so full of plot and sub-plot that readers must juggle all those narrative balls at once. That Fforde can bring all this together at the end shows that his mastery of his world has grown since the start of this series, "The Eyre Affair."

While not as inventive as his previous book, "The Well of Lost Plots," Fforde's world-building is largely done, so "Something Rotten" can focus on the story and not on backstory--that's a big plus. Longtime readers of the series will find that this fourth book finally illuminates some of the backstory that existed even in the first book. For instance, we finally get to see who Millon de Floss is and get a better look at the genetic experiments that have resulted in an England overrun with mammoths, dodos, and Neanderthals.

All the typical humor that we've come to expect from Fforde is here and he's done well picking up the mantle of Douglas Adams. Someone has to write nutty British sci-fi and Fforde is doing it about as well as anyone right now. And while "Something Rotten" is a terrible place for new readers to jump into the Thursday Next books, for fans of the series this is probably the most satisfying of his books.

Enjoy
