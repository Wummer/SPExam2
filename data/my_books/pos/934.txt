I really enjoyed this work. Didnt know this guy won a Pulitzer but it figures. I was swept away by the imagery created by this master. It was evocative of Cooper (although he surpasses Cooper), and McMurtry and the guy who wrote Aquot;all the pretty horsesAquot;. The Aquot;masterAquot; can always create the world to drown the reader in - this guy is great - I plan to read the whole series..
