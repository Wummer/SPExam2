Engrossing and amusing travelogue by world's crankiest traveler.

Some people really hate Theroux, accusing him of snobbery, self importance, and bigotry.  I can certainly see why some readers wouldn't be able to deal with his style and opinions, but I must say that this volume might be a pretty good litmus test of readers' tolerance for the author's travel works.  (If you can enjoy this one, you'll probably enjoy his other non-fiction works).

I, for one, totally enjoyed hearing about grunge-y has-been towns, obnoxious holiday camps, and seedy hotels.  To me, the book was a real page-turner, and he writes so vividly of scenery.  I felt he wrote about the worst bits of his trip with true humor, reminding us travelers that it's helpful to keep a sense of humor during the rough times.  

I felt the book was a pretty decent scouting report for the island's shoreline, and I now know what to avoid there.  I can definitely thank Theroux and his fussy standards!  

If you like Theroux, it's a good bet you'll love this one.
