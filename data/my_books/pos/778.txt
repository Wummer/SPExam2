Having read all of McCarthy's other books already, I came into this knowing what to expect as far a style and content.  And I was not disappointed.  McCarthy can better develop a character in two sentences than most authors can in two chapters.  The vivid description of the mountains, the people, and their culture puts the reader right there in the story.  These harsh, terse, and somehow always beautiful images will remain in my mind for a long, long time.      I found this story a little more abstract than most of McCarthy's other works, yet I was able to see his message in the end.  Required reading for any McCarthy fan
