I was so impressed with this book that I wrote the following letter to its author:

I just completed your book Time Tactics of Very Successful People.  The book is truly a masterpiece, and I have found it immeasurably helpful in my ongoing pursuit to become the best person that I can be.  Your book is full of wisdom and great ideas, the value of which is many times the price I paid for the book.  I have read the works of personal development legends like Napoleon Hill, Brian Tracy, W. Clement Stone, Tony Robbins, Mark Victor Hansen and others and have benefited from all of them, but I really enjoyed reading your book because I found that you offered some fresh ideas that these other great men did not. I am sure that the extraordinary concepts your book provides will enrich my spirit, enlighten my mind, and serve as conduits for achieving my goals for the rest of my life. I really liked the way that you ended the book.  The quote you gave from Earl Nightengale perfectly reflects my philosophy for successful living, but helped me crystallize my thinking in a way that has helped refines my philosophy further. 
  
Thanks again for providing the world such a valuable resource, a guide which I am certain has helped and will continue to help many others to live happier, more productive, and more peaceful lives.
