This is the story of another tragic episode involving a Native American tribe.  That this probably happened under other circumstances, and happened to more than the Arapaho tribe, cannot be doubted.  This is another in a  series that has given us insight into tribal life and continues to  leave  us wanting more.  The characters are strong, believable, and you want the  best for all of them. The underlying plot--selling tribal babies and  telling their parents they died--is heartbreaking.  The reunion of one such  child with her father made me weep.  And Vicki's trial reconciliation with  Ben gave me hope.  This is a great work, written with deep feeling
