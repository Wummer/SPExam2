I liked this prep guide because it's not one of those huge books that's impossible to fit in your carry-on or laptop bag if you're traveling.  It has enough information to pass the test, which is good enough for me because that's all I needed to pass the test this month.  But, if you're one of those people who has a need to get every single question right, this is not the book for you.  The book doesn't cover every single thing you need to know for the exam, just enough to pass it.  The only draw back to this book is that it doesn't come with a CD with a comprehensive set of sample test questions.  I had to go to one of those huge books that I bought a couple of years ago for that, but I didn't read the huge book
