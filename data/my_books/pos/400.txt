Kate White introduces us to the world of tabloid reporting in a sassy titillating crime novel--Over Her Dead Body. 

I could feel the slime drip off the characters that were responsible for keeping the Buzz and its rag competitors in production. While the mention of 'current' celebrities will date this book, Kate's spellbinding storytelling definitely has 
staying power. 

Over Her Dead Body is a fast-paced novel about the murder of the Mona Hodges, Editor in Chief of the Buzz, who had a long list of hostages in her wake, each one having good reason to hate her or perhaps kill her-with a sprinkling of romance for levity. 

Even though the main character, Bailey Weggins, a celebrity crime writer, gets discombobulated many times throughout the investigation, she is clever enough to pull together the pieces of the mystery to its conclusion. 

Right to the end Kate White keeps the reader guessing on who did this horrible crime. 

I am looking forward to reading more Bailey Weggins' mysteries. Don't keep us waiting, Kate!

Armchair Interviews says: Sounds like another good summer read.
