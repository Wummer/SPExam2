From the beginning, Roberto was different.  He loved his wood, but he'd always rather play with his food than eat it.  More than anything he wanted to become a famous architect like his heroes, Hank Floyd Mite and Fleas Van Der Rohe.  Belittled at home by the other termites and never taken seriously, Roberto sets off for the big city to Aquot;build his dreams.Aquot;  Life in the city is hard, and not just for Roberto.  He meets all kinds of bugs with housing problems, including roaches chased from a diner, a housefly with no place to go and a poor ladybug whose house is on fire and children are gone.  Marshalling all his determination, Roberto decides to build a new community, that will meet the needs of these out-of-luck bugs and maybe make his architect dreams come true at the same time..... Nina Laden has written and illustrated a delightful and amusing story with a most improbable hero and youngsters will be rooting for Roberto as he chases and finally realizes his heart's desire, in his bug eat bug world.  Ms Laden's witty text, full of creative wordplay, will charm adults as well as children and her outstanding collage artwork, so full of wonderful detail, really brings this story to life.  A terrific picture book for youngsters 4-8, Roberto the Insect Architect lets everyone know that with hard work, your dreams can come true
