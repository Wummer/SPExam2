I enjoyed this novel. It wasn't Hiaasen's best work but it was well beyond a lot of novels one could read. 

Hiaasen has the ability to look at the lower end of society and bring out the humour in how they conduct their lives. In this novel, two people win the Lotto. Ordinarily this would be a cause for celebration but when one of the winners bemoans the fact that they have to share their spoils with another and they are wanna-be white supremists, then the adventure starts. 

The shenanigans of the characters is both humourous and engrossing, this is a book that I recommend
