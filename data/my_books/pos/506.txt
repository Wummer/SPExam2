I find it difficult to rate and review parenting books with such specific agendas, such as The Continuum Concept.  I fear that alone this book would render a nervous, new mother terrified of failure!  I am wary of books that pretend there is only one way to raise every child.  That said, I adore text that encourages instinctual, intuitive parenting.  Coupled with the dozens of other parenting guides I have read (from all spectrums), The Continuum Concept is a very valuable book.
