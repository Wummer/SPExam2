There is no way, you should limit yourself to just one source, this book is a second source book,(Maybe even third source).

That said, It's great for looking up names, (there is a lot listed) For finding names that may not be household, then looking at better sources for more info.

There is no book that has everything, every name, every movie star, if so, it costs 500.00 or the book weighs about 10 pounds.

You don't want to buy a library? ok, then, it's ok by itself, its fun by itself, to just do browsing, almost, (but its not) 
a coffee table book.

It works well with other book sources, to check, and maybe another source will prove it wrong, or "Who's Who" proves the other book wrong, when double checking.

I didn't find loads of errors in here, a few, the biggest problem (as others mentioned) is very brief or not complete career lists, movies or TV they did is not complete.

It's not a great book, it's a great second source book, 
a double check or name finder book, for movie and TV stars.

At a fair price, it should be in your collection just for the reasons I mentioned.

Buy it? yes, buy it
