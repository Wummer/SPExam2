John Falk takes the reader on the journey of his escape from depression.  And while medicine plays a key part in his freedom, we also see how a brutal and bloody war also plays a role.

His description of his illness is juxtaposed nicely against teh atrocities of war and his insights into himself and the war are poingant.

A good read
