I bought the book the other day and breezed right thru it.  It's great in that you can skip around the book to the sections you NEED to read (or refresh yourself on).  I keep it handy because I often refer to it.  It is thorough in explaining various aspects of reading music, playing, etc.  The humor interspersed makes it enjoyable to read rather than boring but the humor doesn't detract from the content and lesson.  Glad I bought it and you should buy it, too, if you want to teach yourself how to play
