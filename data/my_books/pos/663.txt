    I have just finished my sophomore year in college and in my first course relating to information and computer security we used this book. I would recommend it to anybody who is interested in getting into the rapidly expanding field of infosec. 
     As they say with the CISSP certification, it is an "inch deep and a mile wide". This book covers many, many topics however it is really intended to be an introduction to these concepts.
     It gave me a good overview of information security concepts and prepared me for senior level Infosec courses as well as preparation for graduate school.

*Note that preparation for the CISSP exam would require much more then just this book
