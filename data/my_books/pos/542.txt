I can't go on enough about this book. It should be required reading in colleges and for those in all levels of government, Wall Street and industry CEOs.

The writing is excellent. Many of its passages read like prayers. I can't think of topics and subjects more important than those Jensen writes about -- our cultures diconnection from the natural world and from ourselves and how it has impacted our mental and spiritual health and the health of the earth.

Jensen is so passionate about these topics that he does repeat certain ideas, BUT instead of ruining it, I think the non-linear trajectory of his book actually enhances his message.

The first half of the book where he discusses problems can be hard-hitting and difficult to get through certain parts of it, BUT please hold fast through the end. It is worth it.

Jensen's eloquence and wisdom are best when he is also discussing answers, or possibilities, as it were.
