As a therapist (16 yrs), I have been using the material in this book for reframing the experience of depression for my clients.  The clients I have introduced this book to are now reframing their illness as an intiation  into a greater understanding of their relation to self/soul.  While at  times dry for most laypeople, It has become a reference book for my  practice
