This is one of those life changing books.  I first came across this while looking midlessly through my local "spiritual" bookstore and ended up reading the entire thing in the next two hours.

As a fast read, with a simple, concise message, this book lacks nothing.  It isn't dated, unless you consider religion or spiritual ideas dated.  Richard Bach creates a story that can effect you as much or as little as you want- but it teaches the precepts of becoming a messiah yourself and helps you to view Jesus, Christianity, God, and yourself in a brand new light.  

Needless to say, this is a five out of five.  Buy it today and then give it away
