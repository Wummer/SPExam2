In a hobby filled with opinions, this was a one-stop shop for beginning to up-and-running of my first large aquarium. It was exactly what I was looking for in a book of this nature. I'm not going to say it's the best, worst or in between because it's the only one of this nature I bought. 
Since then, of course, like most folks, I've read web sites, talked to others in the hobby and formed my own opinions. 
But the reason I bought this book was to cut through the confusion and get started and for that, it was terrific. Could have used a bit more on fish and plants and that's the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. Next revision, he should throw in a bit more on the fish he picks, offer some alternatives within the scenarios he set up
