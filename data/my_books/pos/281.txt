This book is a wonderful all-color rendition which has important
factual information on the tallest man, the tripling of the
population in the past half century and the spectacular
Olympus Mons on the Marsian surface- just to mention a few of the many features contained.  The book is perfect for
student projects in science and the arts. It well worth the
price charged
