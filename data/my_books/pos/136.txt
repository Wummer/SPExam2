Once again I am amazed by the amount of controversy associated with a book addressing a religious subject.  I bought this to get a better feel for the Old Testament [operative word is "feel"].  As a Roman Catholic, the Old Testament is addressed in the first reading at Mass, but then brushed over for the most part in a cursory manner.  It is particularly confusing, hard to read, and difficult to understand in proper context, without some help.  In fact there are portions of the Old Testament that just seem cruel and ridiculous.  Davis's book helps to demonstrate that it was written by people, in a certain time and place, and within a historical milieu.  It may not maintain the historical accuracy some may like, but it is sufficient to be effective.  

It is just too simplistic to look to the Bible for all answers; as if it were some sort of statutory code, with the answers to all questions.   The search and answers for truth are never ending, and the Bible is a beginning.  I get more from Catholic writers who explore the Bible and the traditions of my religion relative to our world, than I do from the book itself.  Davis is throwing in his spin, as well as a pretty accurate assessment of the Bible in historical context, which I found quite helpful.  

Take it for what is worth, a spin in a convertible through the Bible.  A nice ride, but nothing more.
