If one approaches this book with a view to learning Music Theory, one would be slightly disappointed.  The author brushes right through the fundamentals but that is to be expected from an outline book of this type.   All in all, I think this book will come in useful after I've learned Music  and need to review theory from time to time.  Great book though
