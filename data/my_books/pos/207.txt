This is an aweful story--you should read it, absolutely.  

I dread the turn of every page, so I'm recommending it to my closest personal friends as well.

And since this is about terrible things happening to would-have-been-happy small children, I cannot in good conscience forget to recommend it to my brother so that he may read it to my nephews.

The most terrible story I've ever read--five stars
