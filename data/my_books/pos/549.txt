I always look to see if an author stands in their truth.  If they walk their talk.  Dr. Christiane Northrup does.  I have read all of her books, Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom, The Wisdom of Menopause and now Mother-Daughter Wisdom.  They all embody her path to well-being and her knowledge on the subject of women's health.   In her book Mother-Daughter Wisdom, she shares her own life experiences from raising two daughters and her expertise as a medical doctor and relates them to health and wellness.  I find this book to be a great tool and guide to help mothers raise empowered daughters and a model for a healthy mother-daughter relationship.  I have three grown daugthers and would have loved to have had this book when they were growing up.  I found out through much trial and error how to raise empowered daughters.  Dr. Northrup is a pioneer in our time venturing into these unchartered waters of how mothers and daughters can have a balanced and loving relationship.  She addresses the many challenges in our society today facing girls and gives suggestions on how to deal with them in a positive way.  She talks about mothers caring and nurturing themselves in order to care for their daughter.  This book is also a  reference book as Dr. Northrup covers from birth to adulthood for the many stages in a mother and daughter's life.  Mothers, men, and women without children, would benefit by reading this book to connect with their own legacy with their mother or if raising a daughter.
