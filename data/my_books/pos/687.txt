Great gift from Grandmother. Children love this book. It's a great book for anybody learning the English language. EVERY class should have this book. This is a gift that everybody appreciates.  Get the book down for the child to look at and learn. Great teaching tool!  Exceptional pictures! I always buy two--one for the new grandchild, and a copy goes to the school, when they start school.  You have my vote for the VERY BEST
