Devoted entirely to coming to Amazon to trash conservative books? I see the same names here I saw for Kate O'Bierne's book, Tony Blankley's book, Michelle Malkin's books, David Limbaugh's books...you get the idea. And most of your reviews say almost the exact same thing, too. You'd think SOME of you would aim for creativity, especially when you're accusing Republicans of being mindless automatons.

That said, York's research is impeccable, and anyone who paid attention to the last Presidential election knows EXACTLY how hard George Soros, Hollywood, et al. worked to push Kerry through, from Cameron Diaz's teary "If you want rape to be legal, don't vote" lunacy on Oprah to the dollars moveon.org spent demonizing the Swiftboat vets. No one works harder than the Left to silence dissenting opinion and hide the truth. It's because of books like this one, conservative talk radio, and Fox News that conservatives finally have a voice in this country, and the left hasn't had to debate for so long, they've forgotten how.

To anyone looking for truthful, incisive commentary on how far the Left has gone to demonize and destroy Bush, how much time, money, and effort they've wasted to obstruct him at every turn, regardless of whether the policy in question would benefit the country, this is an excellent book. If you're a mind-numbed leftist automaton that opposes everything purely on unquestioning ideological grounds--well, I guess I'll be seeing your reviews on the next conservative bestseller, won't I
