I am admittedly a terrible cook, so I follow recipes to the letter, often with nonmagical results. With Julia Child in my kitchen, however, things are looking up! Her recipe for roast chicken was so exact that even I could not mess it up. That and the sauteed beef steaks are now my go-to dinners because they are easy and reliable.  I've also had great success with the quiche and biscuit recipes and look forward to trying breadmaking for the first time.  This book is essential for anyone out on his or her own for the first time, newlyweds, or people like me who just don't get it (but really want to)
