Rather than reading a biography of Red Auerbach, Wilt Chamberlain and Bill Russell, turn to this period book! Here you get everything: a complete portrayal of the situation of African American who were just starting to segregate professional sports outside of the Brooklyn Dodgers. But at the same time it is an introduction to a time, when athletes were not the superstars of today.
On top of that, you get enough biographcal information on Russell and Chamberlain, but also on Cousy, Auerbach and many others. 
The book is very well written and starts right with information, no tedious introduction to plough through
