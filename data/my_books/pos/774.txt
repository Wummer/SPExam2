I will probably write a few APA-format papers while getting a Master's Degree on-line and I think for my limited use, "APA the Easy Way" is the right product for me.  I agree with other reviewers that if you do a lot of writing in the APA style, you may need the complete manual.  However, I have the complete manual and since I bought "APA the Easy Way," I don't think I will ever need to use the full-size manual again.  I especially like that it gives step-by-step instructions on how to do all of the "set-ups" for MS-Word.
