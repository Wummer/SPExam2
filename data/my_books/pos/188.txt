I read this book after the authors (Scott A Omari) told me about it on one of the public forums (about GMAT). Excellent book, it's gives the overall picture of what an MBA candidate should look like to an admission officer at the B school. It definitely gives you an edge. This is book is like 'everything about B school applications in a nutshell'. 

There are some methods like drawing a 'grid' to see where you stand, really gives insight into what are your strenghts A the areas you should improve or 'cover' in the application essays.

Overall, not the one A only but very good book.
