It's been several years since I read the book.  Saw it recently, the book seems to be a favorite, of the coffee-house, talky, chattering, left, Marx-Freud-Rousseau crowd.    

However, all this at talk of a "just society" and the "underprivileged" can and does mean only one thing:  A POLICE STATE.   

Anytime, a so-called "theory" attempts to create a utopian state, there will be coercion.   Anytime, there is coercion, you will infringe upon individual rights, freedom of speech, freedom of association and freedom to govern one's own life.  

Instead of a "police state" in the form of a theory of justice.  He should have written a book titled "A Theory of Liberty"  Any society without liberty as the foundation will have coercion and hence the destruction of liberty.   However, this book remains the coffee-house favorite.

Rawls was an "Ivory Tower Pinhead".  A brief bio states that he was a professor all his adult life.  What kind of adults spend their whole life having fake, phony, welfare for intellectual, make-believe jobs like being a professor of political theory. What dat?????  Oh, Please get a real job.

#1.   THOSE CANNOT DO WILL TEACH.....

So much for the ivory tower pinhead.   A theory of justice will lead to a police state, a state of coercion.   What we need is theory of LIBERTY
