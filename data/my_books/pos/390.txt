This novel was amazing.  It is just as good as Jurassic Park and I recommend it to anyone who loved Jurassic Park.  This novel is much better than the movie so if you liked Lost World, then you should definitely read this.  Crichton realistially extends this series and keeps you entertained throughout the book.  Once you pick it up, you won't want to put it down
