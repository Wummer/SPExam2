I bought this book because it was required for a class I am taking.  I had the 3rd Edition already and wasn't too impressed.  But this 5th Edition is much more appealing.  I just became PMP certified and reviewing this book before taking the exam was a great primer to get my head out of pure PMBOK and into real world Project Management.  The case studies and Directed Readings are great for seeing real world PM activities.  I would suggest the book for guidance and classroom type learning.  If you're an experienced PM then this book is too academic and won't feed your intellect.  Buy something else
