He is a nightwalker, a Navaho vampire who because he is only half Nosferatu has the strength not to succumb to the allure of the dark side of his nature.  He is a New Mexico state police officer who is often teamed up with beautiful FBI agent Diane Lopez who not only knows what Lee Nez is but accepts him for his good heart.  Right now they are trying to infiltrate a smuggling ring made up of skinwalkers (Navaho witches) who can shape shift at night and still retain their ability to think like a human.  

These smugglers known as the Silver Eagles go to Mexico in animal form, meet with their suppliers, and return with silver and turquoise for jewelry suppliers who get their products at black market prices.  The two cops seek to arrest humans who are part of the smuggling ring and kill the shapeshifters so they no longer can carry out their evil plans.  While Diane and Lee stalk the Silver Eagles, they are hunted by a vampire who wants to kill them because they murdered her nest including her husband and brother.  They remain on guard at all times because beside each other they don't know who they can trust.

Once again the Thurlos provide readers their interpretation of the vampire mythos unique to the Navaho culture.  Lee can stay in sunlight provided he uses sun block while his speed, strength and night vision make him a better police officer.  In the Thurlos world, skinwalkers are evil creatures who must be killed; a variation on the hapless victim werewolf legend.  BLOOD RETRIBUTION is a fantastic horror mystery thriller that readers of these genres will want to read.
