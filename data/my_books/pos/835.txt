I bought this book to start free weight training at home.  It is wonderful for home use.  The author describes the benefits of weight training and how to lift weights properly(which I found very useful as a first time weight lifter).  I love the descriptions that the author gives for each exercise.  The author also color codes which exercises to do for each level of training.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is first starting out with free weights.
