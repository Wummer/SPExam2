A great reference book to have for any designer, although a little tedious at times a solid read with a great historical overview of the subject. I would definitely recommend to any enthusiastic designer with a thirst for knowledge on things Typographical.

Since reading, I have become more critical of Typography in general and it works as a great guide when in doubt
