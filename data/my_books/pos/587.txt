This book was like Madonna's famous photographic book of 1992 when it hit the shelves in the 1960's. This is Brown's manifesto on the liberal lifestyle which was spawned in that era. Reader beware ... choices and actions have consequence ... and ponder very carefully before being Cosmopolitan long after the expiration date. Living it up does NOT mean reckless behavior. Values are personal but when one woman's values cause her to act in ways that impose the boundaries onto another (ie - affairs with married men) it is as much an imposition as bible thumping over others' heads. People are free to do what they want but if they go down a certain road they have no right to take unwilling others down the path with them. Although now dated and updated with Sex and the City - ask yourself if you really want to be wild your whole life. Retiring one lifestyle for something stable is a rather good thing when the time is right. Helen Gurley Brown has done alot of good for women pursuing careers, enjouing the single life, and having an identity ... but too much too long has a cost. Do you really want to be like Brown and her counterpart Hefner ... 80 years old and taking hormones in some attempt at youth?
