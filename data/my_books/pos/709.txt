I can't say enough about this wonderful book. It's packed full of examples, covers more than just the pre-adoption and placement aspects, and is incredibly non-judgemental. There's so much information here, more than I expected. It really helped me think through all of the issues related to adoption. It's for both birth and adoptive parents, in fact, two of the birth parents we've been in contact with were excited to hear about it and ended up ordering the book themselves. Reading through this book really helped me conquer my fears about adoption. I'm so glad it was recommended to us. If you're thinking about adoption, even if you're thinking that open adoption isn't right for you I highly recommend taking a chance and buying this book. It's great
