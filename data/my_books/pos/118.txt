This audio-book was fantastic. It took off like a horse out of the starting gate at the Kentucky Derby and never let up.

Vincente Callabrese is a part time enforcer/collector for the mob and part time movie producer student. When Vincente is asked to produce one of his classmates screen plays this is a start of a new career for Vincente.

First a name change, from Vincente Callabrese to Michael Vincent. Then it's off to Hollywood where he rapidly becomes one of the hottest producers in the movie business.

Unfortunately, Michael has a hard time shaking his past. When he tries to buy the movie rights to a novel and is refused, he asks his old friend Tommy Povenzano for help. Tommy assures Michael the he will help. This is the start of all of Michael's problems.

In typical Woods fashion this novel is a mover. Though this novel isn't full of excitement, it will keep you on the edge of your seat wanting to see what happens next. It doesn't take long between incidents.

The bottom line here is that this is a book not to be missed.

Choke 
Dead In the Water
Orchid Beach

These are all other options by Mr. Stuart and I would recommend any of them.

Though this book has not won any awards Mr. Woods won the Edgar Alan Poe award in 1982 and was nominated again in 1992. Once you have read or listened to this book you will understand why.
