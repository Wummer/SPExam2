When my sunday school teacher gave us the challenge of reading through the Bible in a year, I thought it was going to be hard.  So I started looking for a one-year Bible.  When I came across this one I was really excited.  It is by far my favorite traslation because it is so easy to read.  I can get through the daily reading in about 15-20 minutes.  It breaks down the hard to read old testament into easy reading.  And one of the best parts is that it breaks down the reading by day, so you are not constantly going back and forth between the books.  Truely one of the best Bibles I have purchased!!!
