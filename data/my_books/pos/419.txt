I always need tissues when I read this book!  It has helped so much!  I teach preschool and one of my students lost his dog.  I gave him this book and Dog Heaven.  His parents said how much both books helped.  It is just so hard for children to understand death.  I think this book goes a long way in validating a child's feelings.  So often children don't know what to feel, they know grief, but there is so much more than that.  It truly helps when children know it's ok to be confused, hurt, and just upset.  I HIGHLY recommend this book
