One of the few Roald Dahl books I read, it remains one of my favorites from childhood.  I saw the movie too, and the movie is very funny, and I felt it did the book justice.

Matilda is about a precocious little girl named Matilda who has a crazy family (who doesn't support her at all and certainly doesn't respect her intelligence).  At a very young age, she is able to read very advanced books and she wins the admiration of her new teacher Mrs. Honey.  The only problem is her dim parents and the evil Mrs. Trunchbull who rules the school with an iron fist.  And then there's Matilda's new found super powers.

It's very funny, the predicaments Matilda gets into and the things Mrs. Trunchbull says, even if she is cruel.  It might be a little scary to very young children, but it depends on the child
