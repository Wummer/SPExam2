Tony Sweet's photographs are breathtaking!  As you look at each photo and associated rationale for how and why he chose a particular exposure or composed it in a certain way, you realize the keen awareness he has of his environment and the obvious care and patience he places in his work.   I am so glad that he shares the technical side to his wonderful work.  I think photographers of all levels will have much to gain by reading and studying this book
