I found this book in a little store in a vacation spot.  I thought is was the cutest, most unusal selection of dogs and sayings I've ever seen.  It's the kind of book that just lifts your spirits and makes you feel good all over.  A wonderful gift for any dog lover in your life.  Wonderful photos and inspirational dialogue. You just want to keep picking it up and perusing the contents. Fun book
