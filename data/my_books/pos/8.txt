John Crowley's well-deserved recognition as one of the best literary stylists writing in the English language is readily apparent in these four fantasy novellas that date from the late 1980's. His Aquot;Great Work of TimeAquot; is an intriguing Rashomon-esque time travel fantasy about Cecil Rhodes and British economic imperialism in East Africa at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries. It was almost as compelling a read as the Aquot;The Nightingale Sings At NightAquot;, which offers a fantastical twist on the Adam and Eve creation myth saga. The other two tales, Aquot;In BlueAquot; and Aquot;NoveltyAquot;, I found much less compelling, but they are redeemed by the same lyrical prose Crowley uses in other tales. It was a wonderful surprise to find this book at a library; a surprise which I think many readers will also discover
