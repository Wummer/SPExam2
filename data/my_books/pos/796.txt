I call this one "Frank Peretti Lite."  It was very entertaining but not a deep as his previous books.  Instead of focusing on sin and spiritual warfare, this one had a creationist angle.  I really enjoyed it, just not the same as his other books.  Also, you have to remember that this is fiction.  Of course the scenario is highly unlikely if not impossible.  But the central point about mutations comes through.  Great summer read
