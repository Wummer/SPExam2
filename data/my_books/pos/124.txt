I handsold so many copies of this book that my local bookstore accused me of emptying out the warehouse so they couldn't order any more.  Reid strives for a journalistic impartiality here but he is so excited by the current evolution of political life in Europe that he carries you along.  I especially love the story of little Portugal, which has unilaterally decided that drugs are no longer a criminal matter but a medical one.  The US could learn from that example, and from many other European examples in this book.  When you read the story about GE and Honeywell, you'll realize we're going to have to, because they're going to teach us whether we want to learn or not
