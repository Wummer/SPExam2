I am a big Tananarive Due fan because she never fails to deliver the goods in terms of interesting plot, storyline and characters, which many can be anyone of us. She is a fascinating author as she creates several different scenarios that are very different over a great span of time and unites them in a way that is nothing short of amazing. Keep up the good work.....A T. Due fan! Trinice S. Moses - Sisters with a Purpose Book Clu
