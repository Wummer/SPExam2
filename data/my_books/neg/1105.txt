This is a badly written, repetitive and self-serving account, largely, of the foolishness of Aquot;portflio insurance.Aquot; That things which are Aquot;just likeAquot; something else may not be so in reality, and that  magic fixes in the market (which after all fly in the face of the  rational-expectations/efficient-market hypotheses which often are built  into the view of the market being relied on) I guess needs to be pointed  out regularly, since hope of quick, uninformed, and painless fixes seem to  reoccur with each new wave of financial charlatans and the greed they feed  on. Jacobs does point out such problems for a particular, rather bizarre  episode, and suggests, not too coherently, that such Aquot;scamsAquot; are  still prevalent. However, He does this in a horribly repetitive and  self-laudatory way that is not really very clearly argued
