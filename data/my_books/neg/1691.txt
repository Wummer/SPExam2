Sure, I had fun reading this book.  But the Amazon reviewer who termed it "highly speculative" is understating the case.  Opinion, conjecture, hearsay, and speculation too often take the place of thorough, solid documentation.  And unlike many other Amazon reviewers, I found McLellan's tone off-putting.  She alternates between patronizing her subjects (the very notion of calling them "my girls," for instance) and setting them up primarily as sources of voyeuristic thrills for the herself and the reader.  Is the book dishy and intriguing and flamboyant?  You bet.  But is the topic of lesbianism in Hollywood well-served here?  I don't think so
