if you have fond memories of ms steele, or no memory at all because you're new to her, please... don't read this book.

liam looks like a child with his long blond hair; he acts up because no one can control him since that's what his parents tried to do to him; he sees any "no" as a slap in the face because once again, that's what his parents did to him.

sasha looks like a cold woman with her pale skin and dark hair always pulled back; she is totally concerned about her reputation: "but what will they think of me?" and can't stand up for her needs; she refuses to lower her standards, but when liam leaves, she falls into a "morbid depression" and goes back to him.

repeat for 300 pages... 

"careless," "self-indulgent," "filler" are three words i'd use to describe it
