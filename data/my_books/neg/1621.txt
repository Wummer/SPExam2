The book is AMAZING!  The CD is HORRIBLE!  Stick to reading the book yourself.  I have over 45 audio books...and this was like listen to a bad commercial.  I had to turn it off. There is no connection between the narrator and the words he is reading.  They don't even state who the narrator is!

I recommend the book to anyone.  The content is life changing
