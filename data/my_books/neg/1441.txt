I had read all about FSM before picking up this book and bought it as more of a conversation piece.

Well, suffice to say this will never get any space with my other books as it is very poorly put together.

Flimsy cover, flimsy pages, it's put together about as well as a children's coloring book.

I too was fooled by the default picture, I thought it was a nice hard cover with a bookmark ribbon like other "religious" texts.

Nothing could be further from the truth.

Hey Amazon, change the default picture to the one which shows the book as is, a flimsy cover with a picture of a hard cover on it
