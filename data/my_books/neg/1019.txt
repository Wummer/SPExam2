I was disappointed in this book--especially after reading the other stellar reviews (which are all, weirdly, from Texas, where the author lives).

When it's a book about logic and clear thinking, a reader expects that book to be free of typographical errors, imprecise logic, and muddled thinking.  Needless to say, I almost put the book down after reading the introduction because of the missing words and typographical errors.  Exampe from page 11:  "Because the real is out there, we must effectively with it...."  Here's another gem from the same page:  "I am sorry to have to tell you that fact, but that is the way things are.  That is the nature of nature.  That is the reality of reality."

Look at page 33.  The author states, "Why when one exception is uncovered, multiple other exceptions surface almost right away is not entirely clear....  Probably this has something to do with the way we humans view reality."  Very disappointing--hasn't this author studied any cognitive psychology?  It's called confirmation bias and it's entirely clear.

One more example!  On page 60, the author states that Barbara Boxer, a senator from California, "doesn't know the difference between a revolver and a semiautomatic pistol" and is "unlikely to shed intelligent light on the relative safety of either gun."  Ouch.  How does he know what Barbara Boxer knows or doesn't know?  She's actually very well-versed on the difference between the two; has he heard her speak on the subject?  It comes across as more of an ad hominem attack than anything.

Anyway, save your money on this book and instead buy Jamie Whyte's CRIMES AGAINST LOGIC.  Now that's a well-written book!
