The book starts out captivating then it suddenly shifts to Elkinks views of painting, that are strongly bent to the favor of abstractionist.  Elkinks thoughts on Jackson Pollocks creative energy is more than I wanted to know.  He devots almost an entire chapter to this already to small book, to his idol.  How Pollock flicks his wrist to get the effect of splated paint just right and Pollocks tourched stance over his works as the canvis is lying on the floor.To much!  I Do not recommend this little book
