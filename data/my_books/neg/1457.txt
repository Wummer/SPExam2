Personally I found this book to be little more than a GRE verbal refresher course.  Sure, it is objective and balanced but so impassionate that such a contentious issue seems like nothing.  I think you can strip away emotion from a social problem so much that it creates the question of, well, then, does this really matter?  In my opinion I feel this is what the author has done.  I was really disappointed in this book
