This book has a lot of names.  I'll give it that.  But, there are some relatively common names that are missing.  And so many invented names.  My favorite of the invented names are Schmoopie and Poogie.  As if these names will show up on a birth certificate!!  
The definitions/origins of the names are poorly researched and confusing.  
For the name "Cowboy" the book tells you it means "country"  for the name "Country" it tells you it means "western".  
Not that either of those is a standard name, but, for "words as names" aren't you going to pick it because it has meaning to you?  
Also, the lists are totally false, something the author (if you can call her that) made up while sitting around drinking with her buddies.  And some of the names on these lists aren't even found later in the book.  (ex. Lynus on the "Party animals" list)
I wish I had held out for a trip to the bookstore instead of just picking up the first book I saw at Walmart.   I figured with so many names I would find one I liked, but I am just so distracted by all the junk that I will never find a good name here.
