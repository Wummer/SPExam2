This is the same old tired suggestions for cleaning up your clutter.  The suggestions given are to install custom made draws that double and triple pull out.  The suggestion for the pantry was to organize cans from little to big (duh) and then group like items together (duh) that's in every single organizing book published so this one is not different than any other.  Also the other suggestion was to install a pull out swinging triple door pantry system.  Oh is that affordable? If I had $75,000 to redo my kitchen I would install the fancy garbage bin that pulls out of the cabinet and the double drawer pot rack with side lid bins.  Come on, don't waste your money on this book or it's suggestions.  Very few pictures and all for the rich.  I thought Good Housekeeping was for the everyday family.  Get it at the library and then return it after you don't read it.
