I bought the book on the basis of the reviews and on a quick read of a copy a friend owned.  It looks really good on the surface and does have a lot of useful information.

One problem I found is that many of the example photos seem to be inserted only to increase the photo count.  Also, because of printing limitations, I find it very difficult to see the differences between before and after examples.

I have edited this review to fix an error.  However, I can not figure out how to change my rating from 2 stars to 4 stars.  Consider this a 4 star review.
