This book is so full of misinformation that I shudder to think (since it is in the Aquot;dummiesAquot; series), that this may be the only information that many people will read before they embark upon a very serious commitment with a dog. 
 
 It is poorly researched, full of dogma and nonsense. 
 
 If you have to read a Aquot;quick bookAquot; find one written by an expert - a veterinarian, or anyone with a track record in animals. Instant info can be found on bulletin discussion boards, magazines etc
