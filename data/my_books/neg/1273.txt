My problem was that these books were missing chunks of pages!  We didn't notice it until book 4 of 6, but 80+ pages were gone!  Now, Amazon was great about replacing the set adn paying for me to return the messed-up set.  This is just a warning to check your boxed set when it gets in for missing chunks of pages!

Of course, the Harry Potter series is great, adn we love having them in paperback
