"Up to the minute".???

Hardly!!

March 2005, the publication date, is a loooong time ago in ipod years, if you have one of the new models, video 60 Gig for example, you will be sorely dissapointed, it talks about the nano and photo i pod as the "latest edition to the ipod family", well they are now teenagers and probably due to be retired at any moment, ipod mini anyone? Those things are Neolithic now, yet are given too much space in this "up to the minute" book as if they had just been released! 

Go to Borders, look thru their ipod books and find the one with your ipod in it, if you have a brand new one as at May 2006.
