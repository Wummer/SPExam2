A biography about a boy - and a very tough and brave one - who was in battle for such a short time he was spared the continuous horror that veteran survivors (or killed and maimed) of Iwo experienced. He saved the wounding or death of the three other members of his fire team in an apparently instinctive and singular act of self sacrifice. By strict definition, this act was deserving of the Medal of Honor. His terribly painful recovery from wounds received is heart wrenching, but the relatively odd sense of personal glory is in sharp contrast with other accounts of Iwo veterans, or any other battle, I have read. The other accounts I have read generally conclude: War is a horrible thing to experience, and not glorious, but "I would do it again.........".
The recent books I have read will illustrate this contrast:
"GOODBYE, DARKNESS", William Manchester
"GOD IS NOT HERE.....", Richard Overton
"THE QUIET HERO", Gary W. Toyn
"FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS", James Bradley
"THE LAST LIEUTENANT", John Shively
These men may have entered combat as boys, but they certainly left as men.
