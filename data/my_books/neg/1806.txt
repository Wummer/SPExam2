I am agreeing to the comment of "E for effort" on this book.

This book describes the author's attemps to improve his condition and how he suceeded. But he admits in his book that he is not sure which ones actually worked. Plus, the author also takes diabetes medications, along with other medicines and supplements. My main concern is what worked for him probably won't work for someone reading this book.

This book does not really provide a clear picture on what to do. He made so many changes on the medications and supplements, it is hard to say what worked.

One can find the general imformation presented in this book on "Diet", "Exercise" and "Stress management" (relating to clog arteries A heart diseases) through the internet. I didn't gain any new information by reading this book.

The printing of this book is also done in a very strange way. 
The text is printed at the center, occupying only the center area with a lot of spaces around, so about half of the page is blank.
