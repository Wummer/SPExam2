This book provides nothing new.  It is centered on the whole idea of setting up your retirement accounts so they automatically deduct from your paycheck.  If you have 401k, duh, it does that automatically...anyway, boring.  It also says to save money, don't use credit cards, pay yourself, blah, blah, blah.  Oh yeh, if you save early you will be a millionaire in like forty years...zzzz.   Ok, it did help me by reminding me about the interest rates in banks.  One idea was to put the emergency funds in a money market account which offers a higher interest rate than a regular savings account.  Upon reading this, I decided to do this and doing this made me realize the dismal .2% I've been earning on my saving account.  And not realizing the latest craze started by ING, all the other banks offer an "online savings" account which offers 5% compare to the dismal .2%.  I immediately switched!  Other than this part of the book, it was boring
