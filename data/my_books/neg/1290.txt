What a disappointment!  Based on reviews, I couldn't wait to get this book.  Don't let the 48 pages fool you...half of the pages are pictures, and the half with writing on them are double-spaced with wide margins.  Took me all of 20 minutes to read (and only that long because of all the page turning).  Nothing wrong with being concise....except that the philosophy here is overly simplified.  Quindlen goes to great lengths to equate "Pefection" with "Conformity" and condemning it as inauthentic.  I do believe that women tend to set unrealistic expectations for themselves (i.e., wanting to be the perfect mother, perfect daughter, perfect wife, perfect businesswoman); therefore, it creates warm, fuzzy feelings to hear someone criticize perfection as being "boring".  Unfortunately, to claim that "[well-behaved women] don't make good lawyers....or businesswomen" just doesn't follow.  This is not deep reading.  20 minutes?  Don't waste your time.
