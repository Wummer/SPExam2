I did not like the book.  It did have some interesting points to consider, but it did not seem like discipline to me.  I am more of a Love and Logic fan.  I think kids cannot always see the natural consequences of their own behavior (or don't care) until far into the future and must sometimes have consequences imposed upon them, which this book says not to do.  I just don't agree with it
