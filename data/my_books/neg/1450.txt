I agree completely with the Becksted review (I also noted that it was helpful, but I meant it would have been helpful had I read it before I bought the CD).

This refers to the CD version.  I did listen all the way to the end, I kept thinking there was going to be something, but continued to be disappointed.    

I found the analogizes to be strained beyond usefulness (evaluating someone's integrity by the size and shape of the wake they create... are their people waterskiing on it?) 

It seems to be politically incorrect to come out in opposition to "integrity" in this day and age, but frankly this book didn't help me much.
