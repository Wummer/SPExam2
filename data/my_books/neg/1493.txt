I would normally not read Barbara Taylor Bradford but my boyfriends' Mom gave it to me as part of a present, so I said what the heck, I'll try it.  

Just as disappointing as I'd expected. Light, uninteresting, and with no real plot or ending. As for the historical pages, read Catherine Cookson instead.  

I may go back and listen to A Woman of Substance only because other reviewers seemed to have enjoyed it.

But this sequel was too into clothes and the finer things, and full of too-successful, too-beautiful men and women. Not believable.
