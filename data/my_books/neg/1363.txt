I was looking for a book with practical advice on how to handle real-life situations.  I felt most of the book talked about how to parent, i.e. cosleeping, wearing baby, etc, but did not give advice on how to handle a specific situation.  What do i do when my child runs away from me toward the street and then hits and bites me when I pick him up?  I don't want to spank, but a 24-month old just doesn't take to "a talk" or timeout like Dr. Sears says he should.  The Sears Birth Book was amazing, I recommend it to anyone, but this book did not help me answer my questions
