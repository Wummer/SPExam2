This book was suggested reading as if Aquot; THE GREAT SECRET to PERSONAL FREEDOMAquot; was going to be revealed. It spoke of a self-centered mindset that seemed to suggest that I was to live my life how I wanted and not consider how my actions would affect others around me. A very simplistic and selfish point of view
