I looked at the 2002 printing as well as this 2006 revised printing in order to see what has been updated and all the reviews are identical. why? which edition are people reviewing? I think Amazon is making a mistake by not alloting reviews properly.
I don't plan to buy this book until I can see the 2006 version and see if it's worth it myself
