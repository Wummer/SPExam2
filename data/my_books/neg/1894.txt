I bought this book but should have listened to my gut feeling...look at the picture of the "Forever Cool" Ms Mathieson
on the cover.  She keeps saying GET RID OF THE GLASSES in the "before" pictures but she should take her own advice. 
The before pictures of women are so bad that "duh" the after pictures do look better.  However the over-all impression is that the book "teaches" you how to dress so you blend in in suberbia, not how to be individually stylish or dress to look like anything except someone with a credit card who went to the local shopping mall and bought whatever was socially acceptable.
