I have sent away for a book called "Lord Given Lovers:the Holy Union of David A Jonathan" as I find the subject very interesting in this day of same sex marriages, now that David has been used in this subject as married to Jonathan, in the days when the Scibes who wrote the law against such things, I would like to know why David and Jonathan were not stoned to death according to that same law, and if David did such a thing, I would believe that all the Jews then would have did so to, copying David and Jonathan`s example
