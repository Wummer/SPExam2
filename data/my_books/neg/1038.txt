I gave this book two stars because the book was a little boring and dragged on in some areas. The best information was in the margins and the quotes not really any of the information in the book. I have read: Carolyn, Bill, and Amy's books and I want to give this one a try. 

This book is truly for The Apprentice TV lover but if you are looking for business advice this is not the book for you
