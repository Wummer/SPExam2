I'm a pretty diverse reader, so I decided to give this one a go.  It started out somewhat interesting, but then just sort of made me keep saying, "Okay...what's the point here?"  I really like Ninah, the main character, but I keep waiting for her to break free from the chains of this commune she lives in.  I guess the ending is somewhat a symbol of her doing this, but I closed the book wondering, "why did I read this?"  I grew bored with a lot of the goings on in this community and found many of the "punishments" just ridiculous.  I'm pretty open when it comes to accepting different religions, but this was just way out there for me.  Ninah's relationship with her Nanna was the neatest one in the book.  I'm glad I'm finished...now I can move on to something more fulfilling.
