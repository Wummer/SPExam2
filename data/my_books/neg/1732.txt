I picked up this book at the airport as I was heading to Japan. While staying with my in laws in the country, there is no English language anything. This is all I brought so I had to finish it. But it was a struggle. 

Firstly I like complex thrillers, and I liked all the Tom Clancy Jack Ryan series. Technically excellent, if with totally one dimensional characters. 

This book reminds me of the original Star Trek, where everyone but the Captain is affected by the virus. The hero is always right. 

Bell can write, his prose, I think is fine, but the scenarios are sometimes laughably implausible. I also agree with another reviewer here that there is an unpleasant racist overtone in some of his depictions of some of the bad guys. 

Overall awful, just awful. My first and last Bell book. I will be leaving the rest of the Bell collection on the shelf
