This should be retitled "The Leftist, Israel-Hating, Politically Correct Revisionist Guide to the Middle East."       That would be far more accurate.     For a textbook, the author freelances just a tad bit too much, a lot of what is in here is presented as fact but is mostly opinion in disguise.    The author fails in presenting a clear and unbiased view of the Middle East and instead allows his personal politics to get in the way.       

    My professor dumped this book as the course textbook 1/4 of the way through the semester due to the never-ending left-leaning political commentary.    This is no serious review of the Middle East, just a socialist-based fantasy on how THINGS SHOULD BE.   The author himself proclaims that accuracy isn't always important, its the idea that matters.

      This book is a joke, I looked for something serious, unbiased to aid me in learning more about the Middle East but this book doesn't present anything new and its political leanings are just to the left of Stalin.


     If you want to learn what an extreme left liberal thinks of the Middle East, buy this book, otherwise stick to encyclopedias and hopefully, less biased college textbooks.
