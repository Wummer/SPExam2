Have you ever met a person where every single thing that happens to them is a spiritual awakening?  The kind of person that can't go to the bathroom without making some sort of journal entry of the new vistas they discovered?  Well that is the kind of mentality you get with this book.  You can't simply look at a sunset and be in awe of nature or God.  No you need to relate to it and make it a part of you.

I am avery spiritual person and love traveling.  I have traveled all over the world and feel complete when I do so.  Reading this book did the one thing I never thought was possible, it put me off of traveling.  

Fortunately, the feeling passed quickly.  I will not make little travel shrines.  I will not take little spiritual trips across my living room.  I will not follow this persons advice.  And this book is going nowhere near my rucksack.  Sorry, I am too stoic for this book.

I would recommend people read books about the places they want to go.  Learn their culture and a little bit of their language.  Don't worry about the trip just go on it.

My passport is the only material possession I truly value.
