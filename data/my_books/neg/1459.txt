The book claims to help you:

1. Say goodbye to aching joints, sagging skin and fatigue
2. Improve the quality and function of the genetic material in your cells
3. Ramp up your body's self-repair functions
4. Increase your stamina, endurance and sex drive
5. Dramatically improve your resistance to disease, including cancers
6. Have more youthful, radiant skin

You don't need to be a cynic to be able to tell that the claims are all inflated. Sure, you'll see some improvement if you have been leading a very unhealthy lifestyle, but for those of us who are already exercising regularly and eating a relatively healthy diet, some of the tips on progressing further to "genetic repair" will sound a bit too good to be true.

In fact, most of the advice and recommendations given in the book are not very different from that found in many other books on nutrition and supplement. The authors just gave all the info a "DNA twist". I stopped reading the book a few chapters from the end when it begins to talk about hormonal supplementation and some glowing testimonial on the author's services. All "natural"? No side effects? How long have the subjects been followed up and how long have physicians really practised hormonal therapy on otherwise healthy individuals? The results may be real, but how safe is it for the rest of subject's life?

Sounds like another one of those practice-promoting books in this genre. Disappointing
