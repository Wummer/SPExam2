This book was a complete waste.  It was boring to read and hard to follow.  I finished the book just see how it ended and hoping to clear up the confusion.  I never should have read past the first chapter.  Read Pop Goes the Weasle, or Lake House by Patterson.  Just not this book.  It is hard to believe it is written by the same author
