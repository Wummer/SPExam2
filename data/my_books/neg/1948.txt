I remove children from abusive parents daily.

Legally, you cannot hit your child with anything but your open hand on any area but your child's buttocks.  If a neighbor, friend, teacher or family member calls Child and Family Services because your child reports to them that you are doing what Dr. Dobson advocates, your child could be removed from your care.
