Of the thousands of books I've read in my life, and the hundreds I've actually purchased from Amazon.com, this is the first time I've felt strongly enough about a book to write any sort of review.

I kept waiting for the author to get to the point.  He rambled and meandered and didn't tell me anything new whatsoever.  He used the words "alchemy" and "alchemists" in almost every single paragraph of the book.

Skip this book - you'll get MUCH more out of the "Cosmic Trigger" series, "Quantum Psychology", or "Prometheus Rising" by R.A. Wilson.
