How some people gave this book a five star review is way beyond me.  First of all, I'd just like to mention that this nice book gives you schematic diagrams using symbols and other things without explaining them first! Secondly, if you want to understand electronics it can only be assumed that you want to understand the physics behind it! This book dedicates about a sentence to a paragraph to physics for each section.  Horrible! So basically, this INTRODUCTION to electronics doesn't do a lot of introducing you to anything! I'm on transistors right now, and I've spent days researching the physics of how they work on the Internet, and guess what? It's using schematics I don't understand, and yet again I'm going to have to do more looking on the net.  This book is not worth it.  Don't buy it! Just please, for your own sake, find another one.  Also, half the book is dedicated to projects.  That is, actually building electronic circuits! Why didn't the author just entitle this, "How to build electronic devices", then? It's beyond me! As far as explaining things are concerned, the book does very little, and assume you know more than you do.  Unfortunately I'm going to have to end up buying another electronics textbook, because this one is just horrible.  I was really wanting to learn something from this book, but it's just not happening.  For every chapter I've read on this book I've had to do research on the net, and I'm sick of it.  I'm on pg. 154, and I'm closing it.  DO NOT buy this book! I've already found a better book on amazon.com (just buy reading the Table of Contents!!!!!!!!!!) and I'm going to get it!
