I like looking at old pictures and old letters, but I thought when I bought the book that I would actually be looking in the history of someone's life with pictures to go with it but that was not the case.  It is just a random bunch of pictures and a random bunch of letters put together in a book.  The pictures aren't necessarily the pictures of the people who wrote the letters, so you know nothing of the authors, no explanation of the times they lived in or the place they lived in or anything.  In other words, no story behind it whatsoever.  Just a disappointing collection
