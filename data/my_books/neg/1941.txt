This book deals with some fairly rediculous topics.  I'm not into mysticism or talisman's or that stuff, so perhaps I am biased.

It did provide a useful history of the 'masonic' symbol on the American one-dollar bill, which I enjoyed.

But Hieronimus puts forth far too much theory regarding supernatural powers for my taste
