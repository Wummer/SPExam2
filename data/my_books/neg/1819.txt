I am both astounded and confounded by the reviews here.  Simply put, this is the single worst novel I have ever read.  Everything about it--the writing, the characters, the story--is godawful.  Here follows an absolutely true story.  While I was forcing myself to read this drivel, I went out on date.  She and I were discussing how much of a book one should read before giving up on it.  I was advocating the 25 page litmus, and she insisted on at least fifty.  She did several long train commutes a week to and from work, and so read a lot of novels.  Anyway, I started describing this book.  She recognized it immediately, and interrupted me saying, Aquot;The Bear Went Over The Mountain!  Don't read another word!  If you think it's bad now, it only gets worse, if you can believe it!Aquot;  She was right.  If you feel the need to find out for yourself, save your money and borrow it from a friend or the library
