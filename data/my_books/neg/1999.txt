And you shouldn't inhale.
Several reviewers have ecstatically proclaimed this book and movie to be an eye-opening, truth-revealing work, but those who are credulous enough to think they learn history through agenda-focused books and films like "Hunting" need to go back and see other "documentaries" like "Triumph Of The Will", "The Eternal Jew" or "Reefer Madness".
Let's be honest, people. 
This book was written by a strongly pro-Clinton columnist and the movie was produced by well-known FOB (Friend Of Bill) Harry Thompson.  It's about as objective as the factually challenged "Fahrenheit 9/11", a work that Moore himself now calls "satire".  (By the way, I'll bet you didn't know that many Middle Easterners who have seen Moore's movie are outraged at the shallow, stereotypical and racist image he presented of their people and culture.)  
The point is, whether intentional or just laziness these dime-a-dozen political books typically contain significant misrepresentations.  If you're already a member of the author's congregation, you won't care.  You'll shout "hallelujah!" and say that "Hunting" has given the world Great Truths.  But clear thinkers understand that it's foolish to uncritically accept the representations in either this book or the followup movie.
