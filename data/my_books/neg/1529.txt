"A Dirty Job" was my first Christopher Moore novel, and will probably be my last.  I was captivated by the story line as I read the dust jacket, but found that the writing was not nearly as interesting.  I thought the author spent way too many pages with humdrum matters of no real interest, and very little addressing the actual theme of the book.  Although wanting to relate sympathetically to the book's hero, I just wasn't drawn in enough to care about him.  The action began in the final quarter of the book, and you had better suspend reality before reading it.  I actually couldn't wait for the book to end so I could move on to something more interesting
