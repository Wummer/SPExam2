After having read and loved Howard Pyle's 1968 Classic Press
edition of "The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood" I was quite 
disappointed with "The Story of King Arthur and His Knights".
Whereas Pyle brilliantly brought his characters to life in "Robin
Hood", the characters of "King Arthur" seem flat and lifeless
by comparison.  The King Arthur stories read like little more
than a description of events; one doesn't really get a feeling
of being there while things are happening as in "Robin Hood."
The dialogue seems much more realistic in "Robin Hood", but I
think there's more to it.  The writing style in "King Arthur" 
I'd characterize as prosaic---in sharp contrast to the charming, poetic style of writing in "Robin Hood."
