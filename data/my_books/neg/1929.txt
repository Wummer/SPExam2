I really expected more from Coetzee, whom I had never read before picking up this book.  I saw after finishing the book that it was originally published as separate stories or vignettes, and I'm not surprised.  The title character spends all of her time giving speeches, which is strange for a novel--you think you will get a plot, but you just get lectured to.  The writing is good, spare and cogent, but the book does not hang together well enough to be a novel, in my opinion.  The best chapter, which is the last, has little or nothing to do with the prior chapters
