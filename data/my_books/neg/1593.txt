I was lured into reading Under the Volcano after seeing its inclusion on the Modern Library's One Hundred Best of the 20th Century and after reading a reviewer compare it to James Joyce (I am an amateur Joycean who tries to read Ulysess, Portrait of the Artist, and Dubliners at least annually).  Lowry has nothing that likens him to Joyce.  This book is leaden and tedious.  I forced myself to finish it because I hate to start a  book and not finish it.  But it was no labor of love.  It was simply a labor.
