Ladyhawke is a big step ahead of most fantasy flicks. It seems to have all the usual bits: knight on a mysterious quest, lovable thief, and a loving couple under a vicious curse. Even these ordinary pieces rise above ordinary in this film, due largely to the outstanding cast: 
- Rutger Hauer (the knight, of course), 
- Michelle Pfeiffer (the other half of the cursed couple),
- Matthew Broderick (knave with a heart of gold), and 
- Leo Kern (aging hermit, in on the terrible secret). 

Saying much more would mean saying too much, but it has the fairy tale ending you'd hope for and expect - good guys get theirs and the bad guys get theirs.

One thing about this movie (or maybe the DVD transfer) truly annoys me, however. Someone messed with the colors, like a newbie camera geek who just discovered gradient filters, and hasn't learned how garish they can be. To whoever did it: please get someone with normal color vision to check your work next time.

Outside of that, it's a safe, entertaining movie. Enjoy!
