CBS's THRESHOLD held the promise of a good science-fiction thriller; however regardless of it's interesting story premise, good acting, and well supported production team, it, like NBC's "SURFACE" and ABC's "INVASION", was cancelled.  Although I considered it the weakest of the three mentioned, it alone was told before production ended, it was not being re-newed; hence, it had just enough time to provide an adequate series finale and why I rated it 4 vice 3 stars.

Was it cancelled because the plot was flimsy or dumb?  Possibly, but it did offer better tv viewing than many of the boob tube's "reality" shows and less than funny comedies.  

Was it cancelled because it lacked character depth and good acting?  Maybe, but Carla Gugino (Molly), Charles Dutton (Blaylock), Brent Spiner(Fenway), Rob Benedict (Lucas), Peter Dinklage (Ramsey), and Brian Holt (Cavennaugh) did a very good job trying to provide three dimensions to their characters.  Sadly, they didn't have the opportunity to finish the job.

Was it cancelled because it didn't get the support it needed from the folks behind the scenes?  Arguably, but the team did offer some great visuals, interesting plotlines, and nightmare scenarios.

So why was this potentially promising series suddenly suffocated?  Probably because it cost too much money and the average television viewer doesn't appreciate a good story takes time to develop (The X-Files, Alias, 24, Law A Order, CSI, Smallville, Numbers, etc.).

Is it worth buying or renting? Yes.  Though a cancelled series, it has that one thing most of it's one season wonders don't have--an adequate conclusion that doesn't leave you wondering how a cliff-hanger is to be resolved
