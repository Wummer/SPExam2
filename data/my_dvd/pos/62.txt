I am a huge anime fan, and this is by far the best.  Lemme just say, God I can't even find the words to describe to you how wonderul this series is.  It inspires hope and takes the viewer on a journey into myth and fantasy.  The whole series is actually based on a true story in Japan.  A few hundred years ago, the entire population of wolves in Japan became extinct.  There are people there, even today that report wolf sightings occasionally :)

If you're a fan of wolves, or looking for something a little different, CHECK THIS DVD OUT!

The musics great, the drawing is perfect -- not just a random bunch of stills like most animes, but actual movement!  You get 4 episodes per DVD, each is a little over 20 minutes long.  This DVD includes:

19. A dream of an oasis -- this episode takes place right after the incident at the keep.  Kiba finds a place where he is truly happy, and wonders if he has finally found paradise.

20. CONSCIOUSLY -- this is by far my favorite episode in the entire series.  It has gorgeous music, and the scene by the lake will stay with you forever, just brilliant.

21. Battle's Red Glare -- Orcom's men are fighting against an enemy, and the wolves are caught in the middle.  We see a lot of Blue in this episode (she's so cute as a puppy :) and Cher.

22. Pieces of a shooting star -- The group decides to cross a sea of ice, but it turns out not to be such a good idea :(  Toboe goes crazzy and we finally getta see the runt kill some stuff.

I can't say enough about this series -- unless you've seen the whole thing, you can't judge it.  It's made by the same people as "Cowboy Beebop" and this DVD is preparing us for the typical BONES conclusion ;)  The next DVD is way sad and very depressing; no matter how tough you are, you will be crying by the end
