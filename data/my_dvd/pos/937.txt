Joseph Campbell would be proud of this coming of age hero story.

Haru (Chris Farley) is a ninja school dropout. He still maintains a positive attitude. He gets an opportunity to help a Sally, a lady in distress (Nicollette Sheridan). His mission will eventually take him to the hills of Beverly. Sensei (Soon Tek Oh) is like a father to him. Sensei realizing he can not sway Haru from his mission sends another ninja Gobei (Robin Shou) who is Haru's spiritual brother to quietly help.

On this mission Haru, Gobei, and Sensei learn more about themselves.
