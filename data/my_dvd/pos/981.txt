Regarding the above title, there was very little difference between the 2 versions on this edition of the Dvd. There seems little point in the censors deleting the scenes as they did in the USA and the UK as they do very little to the film's context. Still, it's a very good horror film anyways with plenty of gore (if that's what you're into) and I'd still give it a 9 1/2 out of 10
