Not being familiar with yoga, I chose this DVD because of Rodney Yee's reputation and the low cost.  What I found was an easy to follow workout that makes you feel relaxed, and yet energized, after the first session.  There are no bells or whistles, just a great workout.  I've purchases two other titles in the series, Power Yoga - Strength and Power Yoga - Stamina, and I switch off each workout.  Some of the moves are more difficult than others, but it gives you something to work up to.  If I couldn't do a stretch, I would go as far as I could and hold it. It was a great feeling when I was finally able to stand in a pose or do a stretch that initailly I was unable to do.  Aside from these video's, the only equipment that you need is a mat which is extremely important to prevent slipping and back pain...  I DO know this for a fact.
