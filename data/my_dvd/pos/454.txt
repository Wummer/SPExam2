I bought this DVD because it was listed as an IMAX title, but it is also 3D if you buy the special glasses from the manufacturer(regular 3D glasses dont work with this title). The quality of the graphics are terrific, the plot is a little strange, but basically its aliens who invade and ride 4 virtual roller coasters at a futuristic theme park. The rides are pretty good and the concept and setting behind each coaster is unique. My kids love this DVD, and its worth the price!

(Buy it from the new A used section and you can get it for around $3.50 plus shipping
