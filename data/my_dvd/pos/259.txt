I first saw this as a child during an "afternoon movie" event at my gradeschool.  Little did I understand then how well the film emphasizes the basics of parenting, nor did I appreciate the subtle moral of the film, namely that good guys sometimes do finish first, by the very nature of their untainted goodness.

Oh, sure, I rooted for Charlie and his uncle, the poorest of the poor, simply trying to make ends meet.  And who didn't despise Veruca Salt, the bratty English tart--with a pushover for a father--who acted like the world was her private oyster?

But having recently purchased and viewed this movie on DVD with my wife and little daughter, I was dazzled at how magical the Chocolate Factory still is, even in our age of CG film wizardry.  And without having seen the new version, I can't help but think that even the versatile Johnny Depp is not up to the task of leaping Gene Wilder's timeless portrayal of the candy tycoon, Willy Wonka.

More impressive was the fact that this movie clearly dates from a time in hollywood when filmmakers were not above delivering straightforward, old-fashioned morality tales with universal appeal.  Several deadly sins are on display throughout this film, including gluttony, vanity, greed, and avarice; and the end results of these unchecked urges are plain to young and old alike.

The lessons for children and parents are hilariously and sometimes embarrassingly illustrated, and I have to wonder if this has been preserved in the new film, or scuttled for some altogether more nebulous message more in tune with the 21st century postmodernism that Hollywood has embraced?

I'll have to check it out.  Meanwhile, see the classic, and be charmed all over again
