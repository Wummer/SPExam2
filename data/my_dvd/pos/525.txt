I have nothing negative to say at all just want to leave a little info on Battlestar Galactica Season 1. If you are about to buy BSG season 1 and the mini series don't bother picking up the mini series battlestar season 1 comes with the mini series. i didnt know and I  spent an extra $17.00 for nothin. Well someone I know is gunna get that for X-mas so not a complete loss but still kinda annoying if you know what i mean. Happy Holidays 2 U all!!!
