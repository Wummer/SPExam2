No, he doesn't. 
Angel Heart centers around a down in the dumps private detective, Harry Angel and Lou Cyphere, obviously the devil. Well, not obvious to me at first...ha! 
The only bad part about this movie is the fuss people made over it. The voodoo dance scenes were apparently fairly in keeping with tradition. Voodoo practioners had a problem with this movie centering around a "devil" character since there is no devil figure in voodoo. However...the devil character has very little attachment to the voodoo practices, it just happens to be how the devil got involved with Johnney (the missing crooner).
Mickey Rourke is stellar in this movie..Bonet is enchanting...Deniro is flawless. 
Worth owning!
