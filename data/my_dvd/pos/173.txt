This is a great film that preceded the onset of the "JLo."  "Out of Sight" is a great showcase for Jennifer Lopez's talent as an actress.  It is a shame that she hasn't been presented with more great roles, like that of Karen Sisco, in this film.  Karen is a D.A, who carries a rifle and a jaded attitude. She has a chance encounter with charming, compulsive bank robber Jack Foley (George Clooney).  Their encounter is made especially intriguing because it takes place following his would-be kidnapping of Sisco in her OWN car. It is no surprise that sparks fly.....however, this doesn't downplay the complexities of their star-crossed encounter.  

Some of the greatest strong points of this film include the juxtaposition of flashbacks, incorporating trick camera work and voice overs.  What's more, this film was shot in a very bare bones style.  We don't get a sense of romance, so much as a feeling of stark reality.  The colors are dark, the dialogue between the characters is honest, real and simply wonderful.  This film has a potential for mass appeal, due to the fact that, though it does get gritty and violent, that doesn't downplay its intelligence or originality.  Violence is counterbalanced by genuinely funny scenes, as well as more introspective glimpses at how the characters turned out as they did.  This is definitely a great date film!!
