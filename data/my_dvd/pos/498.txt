Most people doesn't realize that this band SUCK'S!!!!
I AM a "HARD-CORE ROCKER FAN" but please!! Is not because this band doesn't know how to play music or is fictional, is beacause it suck's!! 

The reason that Spinal Tap suck's is because of their bloopers in live-concert and most of all THEIR STUPID LYRICS!!!!! 
I mean:
"YOU KNOW WHAT I NEED, OR MAYBE YOU DON'T!!!!!??????"
"LISEN, SHHHHH!! WHAT THE FLOWER PEOPLE SAY AAAAAHHHHH!!!!!?????"
"THE CATS MEOW!!!???"
"SEX FARM WOMAN!!!???"
"BIG BUTTON!!!!??"
"I JUST WANT TO MAKE SOME EARDRUMS BLEED!!!!????"

COME ON! PEOPLE!!!! Try to realize why this movie is sooo funny! BEACUSE ALL THE PEOPLE LIKE A BAND THAT IS PURE GARBAGE!!!!!!
But don't get me wrong! I did enjoy this movie(documentary really) because is a parody of the rock bands in the 60's, 70's and early 80's. And their music is LOUD, FAST and HEAVY!!!

Adios.
