I can't wait for this second season to FINALLY be released.  I bought the first set on a whim and WOW was I pleasantly surprised.  I never knew Alfred Hitchcock had such a fun personality and such wicked humor before viewing his little intro's and exits during each episode.
This set includes 39 episodes from the 1956-1957 season.
The casts of each show are superb and the certain actors who show up in other episodes are always welcome as the new characters they play.  
If you love short, play-like drama's (some are comedy's in a dark vain) you owe it to yourself to check out both season sets and join me and others who hope that the studio's will quickly release all of the seasons for us fans.
Peace  :o
