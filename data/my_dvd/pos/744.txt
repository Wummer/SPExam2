i own many of the 50 packs of movies and i must say i like this set very much.most of these movies are from the 30's and 40's, the hayday of movie mysterys. the transfers are ok ,but not great and some of the movie have sterotype's of all kinds. just keep in mind when they were made,and if they bother you don't watch. a nice set and a great way to build your movie collectio
