We LOVE these movies!  They entertain the child as well as the adult!  We went through a period where we watched these every night before bed!  Much better than the Baby Einstein Collection!  We've made this our designated baby shower gift!  Everyone should have a copy!  They are good for parents as a stress relief.  You don't even need to watch them, just have them playing in the background, the music is absolutely wonderful.  I love when I catch my kids humming the music as they are playing.  Perfect for any age, boy or girl!  Thank you HBO
