Goal! is a well-done soccer version of the road to glory in athletics.  It is a true Cinderella story that makes the impossible possible and fulfills the one in a million shot at stardom.  

The soccer player, a young hispanic man in Los Angeles, gets a one-time chance to tryout for English Premier League power Newcastle.  As the movie progresses, more and more people believe in the young man's dream.

His family relationships are present and well-developed in the movie as is a budding romance.  We see the young player learn about the consequences of his decisions.  There are enough conflicts and challenges in this movie that keep it interesting.

The soccer presented in the movie is very well-done. We see actual professional players make cameo's on and off the pitch..no headbutts, though.  A few times I felt like I was watching an actual English Premier League game...there are just a few too many spin moves over the ball but they look cool.

This is a good movie with a good begining and good ending. I am glad I watched it and recommend it especially to soccer fans
