"GO" takes place in a 24 hour period on christmas eve following 3 of the main characters and events.
all 3 stories intersect with each other with excellent results.
sharp focus on details and time line construction make this a worthy watch! totally original, well scripted, superb performances. if you enjoy this kind of movie, check out "2 DAYS IN THE VALLEY", or "THINGS TO DO IN DENVER WHEN YOUR DEAD".
