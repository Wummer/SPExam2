  I waited years for this movie to be released in the United States.  As far as I was concerned, it wasn't about the acting, as much as it was about the "feeling" the actors wanted to portray, in which they, profoundly, accomplished.  
  I would recommend this movie to anyone who can reach that one step deeper into the minds of creativity and passion, and appreciate the struggles of rising above and beyond the pain of broken dreams
