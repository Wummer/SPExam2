Yes the movie is great but please tell me about the DVD ! How's the quality,are there deleted scene's ,any bonus material ? I think there are about 115 reviews about the movie but I would like more info about the DVD itself!
I am from Georgia where the movie was filmed ....so I'm hoping for some deleted scene's ! Anyone who has the DVD,please give info! Thanks
