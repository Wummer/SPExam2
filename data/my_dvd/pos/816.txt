The uncut version of the anime is much better than what is aired on TV. Though there are still some diferences between the Japanese version and what is in the uncut version. I wouldn't recomend the special edition unless you are a hard core Naruto fan. The bonus items that come with it are mainly geared toward younger viewers and not much towards adult viewrs
