This is one of my favourite Christmas movies - along the lines of It's a Wonderful Life - modern style.  Cage is perfect in this role- surprisingly!  Tea Leone is a great supporting actress and the little girl is adorable - all around a wonderful movie - some mature content though so not for the younger viewers. (robbery and sexual nature in parts)
