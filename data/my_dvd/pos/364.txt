Gosh. The other reviewer, who seems to me, only watched the first four episodes of this series and judged the title soley on that.  Oh, and  on the DVD covers.  This isn't the first anime to have 'fan service' on the DVD covers.  Look at Kiddy Grade, an anime that this tweedledum65 reccommends over R.O.D tv.  I'm not going to get into details on this anime, for good reviews check out www.themanime.org, I'm just saying I liked it, and if you're paitient, and like a good mystery, I hope you find this series just as enjoyable as i do.
