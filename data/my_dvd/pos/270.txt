Any collection that has The Lost Patrol has got to be worth the 40 bucks.  That movie and Boris Karloff alone is something to behold.  But this collection also contains Sgt Rutlidge which a movie way before its time.  Mary Queen of Scots, I wasn't even aware was a John Ford Movie. The Informer another great and Cheyene Autumn.  I think this set has a little bit of something for everyone. I just wish that we knew if this was the 66 minute watered down version of Lost Patrol or the original uncut version.
