Warning! This is not for children. Seeing death, real destruction, and authority figures unable to cope with what happened on 9/11 is not for the young. 

With that being said, this is the real deal, what you probably didn't see on the nightly news. Great camera work and behind the scenes storytelling puts you in the middle of New York City that fateful day.

If you never want to forget what happened The Day that Changed America, you must have this dvd.
