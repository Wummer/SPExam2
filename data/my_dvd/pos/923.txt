Not dissin the USA tour, but i loved the Europe Tour DVD better, after i saw this one. This DVD was a nice Eminem introduction to seeing his concert behind the scenes for me. I can relate to his music madness and Anger issues, it did give me fan comfort while i did homework lessons and Detroit love. I passed it along for other college woman to view~LMAO
I hope i get it back~LMAO

Amazon.com is so amazing, i can just order another one.
