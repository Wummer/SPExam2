Excellent pay per view. One of the best of 2002. Here's the matches:

1) 6-Man Elimination Table Match: 3 Minute Warning A Rico vs. Jeff Hardy A Bubba Ray and Spike Dudley (5/5)
Great opener. Lots of high spots included. For 300+ pounders, 3 Minute Warning really can move. Surprise ending.

2) Cruiserweight Championship: Jamie Noble (champion) vs. Billy Kidman (5/5)
Both looked impressive during the match putting on a superb bout. Watch for Noble's sick DDT and Kidman aerial moveset.

3) Hardcore Match for Women's Championship: Trish Stratus (champion) vs. Victoria (4/5)
A solid women's division match. Tons of weapons but a weak finish. Victoria supposedly injured her ACL in this match but I couldn't find the spot. Maybe you can.

4) WWE Championship: Brock Lesnar (champion) vs. Big Show (2/5)
Of course Brock was able to suplex the Big Show and Brock was able to get him up for the F-5, which Paul Heyman doubted. The match unfolded quickly and equipped a strong end.

5) WWE Tag Team Championship Elimination Match: Edge A Rey Mysterio (champions) vs. Kurt Angle A Chris Benoit vs. Los Guerreros (3/5)
Using a Tag Title bout as a warm-down match didn't pay out well. Rey possessed an intense aereal arsenal compared to his present one. Worth watching.

6) World Championship Elimination Chamber Match: Triple H (champion) vs. Kane vs. Chris Jericho vs. Rob Van Dam vs. Booker T vs. Shawn Michaels (4/5)
I was hoping someone would bring the match atop the chamber, but was disappointed. And the fact that Jericho was a World Tag Team champion at the time puzzled me, since Christian, his partner, wasn't even on the show. Besides that, a great Main Event. RVD nearly crushed Triple H's throat at one point. Jericho knew how to work an Elimination Chamber at perfectly.

Overall 4/5 for Survivor Series 2002. Worth buying
