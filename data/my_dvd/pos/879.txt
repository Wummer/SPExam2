This recommendation is for the uncut version of Leon - The Professional.  A well crafted, tightly edited, excellent story that makes you wonder where the time went when the end credits roll.  An action film that can be appreciated by those who generally don't care for the genre, the character interpretation and interactions alone are worth it.
