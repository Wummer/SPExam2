I just watched this movie last night.  I came across the title on someone's MySpace and being a Jared Leto fan I wanted to watch it.  I had also read a few reviews and talked to some people who said the film was riveting.  

Riveting is the very least I can say about this film.  It is as the Amazon editorial review puts it, "a tour through hell."  This film makes you think.   The fact that all the addicts succumbed to their addictions seems a little out there to me but I keep wondering is it so far fetched . . . ?  How many people are there that actually DO escape addictions?  You might escape one but more than likely you will soon replace it with another.

During the film I kept trying to see the positive side of it all and hoping that there was some middle ground; some little piece of hope left.  I was wrong.  The film didn't depict drug use the way that I had expected to see it; the way I had seen it depicted in countless other films.

All of the ugly aspects of drug use were put out there for your viewing pleasure.  Personally I found it painful to watch.  There  were moments when I actually thought of turning it off but for some reason continued to watch.  I think that reason was the hypnotic trancelike style of the film.  The truth is that I COULDN'T stop watching.  The film put me directly in the shoes of the addict.

I felt like the addicts in the film  . . . my hands sweaty and my heart pounding.  I couldn't close my eyes.  I want to see it again sometime.  I would like to watch it with my husband.  I bought the movie before I had ever watched it the first time.

The film was painfully realistic, genuinely graphic, appalling and appealing at the same exact time.  A MUST see.

Overall I think it is a wonderful film to add to any collection.  Personally it is probably one of the best movies I have ever watched.  I think the acting in the movie was outstanding, the direction was genius, and the plot was amazingly horrific.

All in all this is an 5 star film
