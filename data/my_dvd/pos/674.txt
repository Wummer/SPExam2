This was a blast from the past for my husband and I.  We purchased this for our 6 and 7 year olds and they really like it.  It fits right where they are in school, and they laugh while they are learning.  Often when we are doing homework, I'll say "That's what they said on the Electric Company" or "Remember what the Electric Company said this letters sound like?"  And they do.  It's been a joy to see something from my childhood work for them.  It's great to play in the morning while they are getting ready for school.  -- Plus I have to admit, seeing Morgan Freeman and Bill Cosby in this is quite hilarious (mistakes and all!
