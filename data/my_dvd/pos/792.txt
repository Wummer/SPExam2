This documentary is very concise, and very straight forward.  It does not beat around the bush or preach to the choir.  It features interviews with some very credible sources, all of whom have their unique take on such a timely discussion topic.  I really enjoyed the way the interviews were woven together.  This documentary makes a great point and I'd highly recommend it for anyone who is interested in learning the hard facts about the drug industry and its ethics
