Moonlighting is one of the greatest series to ever grace television. Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd have a chemistry that just makes the episodes work. The scripts are well written, funny when they are supposed to be and serious when they are supposed to be. All I can say is you should check it out and see for yourself. I'm very happy I decided to buy these DVDs.
