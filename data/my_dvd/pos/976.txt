Yet another amazing film from Paul Verhoeven with so much depth and weight I can't even tell you.  Stays with you a long time after the film is over which many of his films have a tendency to do.  Jeroen Krabbe gives an excellent performance as does Rutger Hauer in the leading role.  Everything in this film is top notch particularly if you are in any way a fan of war films.  So many great scenes (i.e. Alex and Eric's tango towards the end, Aquot;april fools dayAquot;, vengeance on a bicycle, the beach scene and many many more.)  See this as soon as possible.  It would make a terrific double feature with the Young Lions
