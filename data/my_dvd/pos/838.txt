This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, it has it all; suspense, good acting, good story line, and without much violence.
The plot is interesting, it keeps you guessing, and the suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat.

Great job Hollywood, to all involved with this film, especially
Jodi Foster
