In all of the other X-men DVDs, they show very little on the couple that i like the best. Kitty and Lance. the first episode Joyride, is when Lance joins the X-men. Not everyone is pleased, but almost all are. Scott is the one who hates Lance and Doesen't believe that Lance is doing this out of truth. well when cars, jets, start mysterisoly getting very dirtty. Scott blames it all on Lance. But is it Lance or is someone else having the Joyride?? and Walk on the Wild Side is a episode very good towards "Girl Power" Jean, Boom Boom, Rouge, Magma,Kitty decide to become the BayVille Sirens. Stoping crime and Wearing Leather in the process. the other Two epsiodes are worth getting the Disc After All, any X-Men DVD is worth it
