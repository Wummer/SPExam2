When I read the description it mentions being able to personalize your workouts.  I thought, "Yeah, right."  But you really can pick and chose and combine what you want.  You can combine high intensity arms with low intensity abs and medium intensity cardio.  It is up to you.  Or you can choose from the basic low, medium, or high intesity workouts.  This is a great workout DVD and Denise is pretty easy to follow for the most part.  I'd recommend it for anyone of any workout level who wants to exercise in the privacy of their own home
