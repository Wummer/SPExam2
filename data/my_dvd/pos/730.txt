If you love Adam Sandler's comedy, you'll adore this outstanding SNL compilation of the Best of Adam Sandler. It features all his best skits, and outlines how great and wonderfully talented this actor/comedian is. Also featured in this DVD are skits with the great Chris Farley, Mike Myers, and other great SNL stars.

The only disappointment from this DVD is that it contains no special features.

Best Skits:

Zagats: This skit features Chris Farley and Adam Sandler playing an old couple who have to decide what restaurant they want to go to for their anniversary. This best displays Farley's comical brilliance, but we also get a great delivery from Sandler.

Opera Man: Always a classic in the field of SNL.

The Denise Show: A classic from Sandler, as he delivers a skit about an ex-girlfriend he can't forget about.

Schmidt's Gay: A hilarious commercial of a homo-erotic beer featuring Sandler and Farley.

Overall, this is a must-buy for any Adam Sandler fan as it features some of the best SNL skits of all time
