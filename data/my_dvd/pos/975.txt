Soldier of Orange with commentary by Director Paul Verhoeven is a must-see for all history buffs, WWII historians and lovers of war movies.  Based on the life of Erik Haselhoff Roelfzema,  it chronicles his life in the resistance and that of  a small group of law students in Leiden, The Netherlands.  Verhoeven's commentary is worth the price of the DVD as he explains scene by scene what he tried to portray, while asking some very thought provoking questions.  Verhoeven and I are the same age, and both of us lived in Holland during the occupation.  His view of the conditions in Holland and the responses of the Dutch under occupation are very different. I also think his references to Das England Spiel are inaccurate.  Having said all that, I still consider the DVD one of my most favorite productions, including the film itself.  Soldaat van Oranje is my choice for best ever Dutch film. Those interested in learning more about the real Eric Hazelhoff Roelfzema should read "Soldaat van Oranje Omnibus" which includes "De Verre Tamboer (The Distant Drummer)" and "Op Jacht naar het Leven (In pursuit of Life)" all by Eric Hazelhoff Roelfzema
