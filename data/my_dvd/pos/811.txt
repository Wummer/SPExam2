If you are at all interested in synthesizers, their impact on the music world, and how the Moog synthesizer changed history, this is a 'must have'.

I just wish I had bought my copy and had Bob autograph it before he passed away. I did go to his memorial service... a little late, I admit. But this DVD gives so much insight into the realm of the synth. There's a fair amount of footage from the 50th anniversary event "Moogfest" at BB King's in NYC, in May of 2004. I attended that show, and was just one table from the stage, right in front of Keith Emerson and his monster-moog. There is also some segments of Bob and Rick Wakeman back stage (It was Rick Wakeman's birthday).

Anyway- good stuff... I would buy it if I were you. I AM me, and I DID buy it, and I'm not sorry!
