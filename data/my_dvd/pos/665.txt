This is the best animal movie I have ever seen..from a child's point of view. This has been our daughter's favorite movie for the last one year or so (she's 3 now) and after watching it almost every day (sometimes several times a day) she still enjoys it as much! We're surprised that even we are not tired of it. The animals are fun to watch, the story is interesting and the music is great. We've bought several other animal movies for our daughter and this surpasses all of them. The production is superb, the animals did a great job and it all seems so real.  A must-by for everyone who has small kids
