I had to replace my video with this DVD version. This movie is spectacular--beautiful photography, excellent acting, and most importantly a tremendous comment on the social restrictions placed on women of the time.  It is based on the true life of one of the first commissioned female artists in Europe.  Artemesia, whose father is an artist, is forbidden to draw or paint the human body.  Her efforts to do so lead her into difficulties.  Her father is supportive but even he must fight the social structure--especially when trying to get her into the male-only art school.  He finally gets her apprenticed to another talented artist and is devastated when he finds they have engaged in an "unlawful" relationship.  He files rape charges and everyone suffers.  A brilliant social commentary
