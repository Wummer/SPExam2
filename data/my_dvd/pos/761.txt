I really enjoyed this movie.  Death Warrant was filled with supense and action. Jean-Claude Van Damme portrays officer Louis Burke who goes undercover to investigate murder and corruption in the prison system. Eventually officer Burke meets up with a convicted murderer that he had arrested and put behind bars. 

I did not lose interest with the nonstop suspense and action.

Sincerely,

Renee Ra
