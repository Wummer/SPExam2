"The master" at acting like a conceited prat! A "master" at complicating a simple situation with self-righteous, snotty, santimonious drivel while making fun of people who he deems are intellectually inferior to his royal self by twisting their ideas and words around to suit his assault on them. He seems somewhat taken with Alan Price who was there to 'brown-tongue' .. or maybe Alan had nothing else better to do, because he had just been fired from The Animals. Price DID get drunk and throw a glass out onto the street much to the annoyance of Zimmerman... he also opened a bottle of beer on a piano keyboard taking a chip out of the instrument showing total lack of respect for other people's property. I guess obnoxious prats stick together, huh?

We see Dylan take every opportunity to make fun of Donovan, and we also see Dylan's manager, Albert Grossman, trying to extort every last penny he can from British TV networks as he lies and plays them off, one against the other, in order to get himself and Dylan a few extra pounds...

Finally there are about 6 musical (musical?? It is to laugh!!) numbers from Zimmy... alone on stage with his guitar, huffing'n'puffing into his harmonica, and achieving little more musical sense out of his efforts than Lou Reed did on his Metal Machine Music debacle....oh yeah, and don't forget Joan Baez! Better still, FORGET Joan Baez!!

Well worth a look.
