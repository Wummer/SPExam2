This is a good cold war drama. After a Soviet spy satellite comes down in the wrong place, the race is on to recapture the film. As was pointed out in the film, the Soviets used their German scientists to launch the satellite containing the camera stolen from England's German scientists using a special film developed by the US's German scientists. The film has the location of both side's missile installations and both sides want it. Neither side will give an inch.

The chase takes place with a US nuclear sub, overcrowded by marines and spies. The problem is that there is a double agent on board who will give up his own life to sabotage the mission. The twists and turns don't stop and neither does the excitement. The film is dated but still a good show. The photography especially is spectacular, especially for that day and age.

Rock Hudson leads an all star cast which does a great job across the board.
