I could explain to you all about each show but you already know. What makes this collection great is the fact as to how it is packaged along with the price. You get 5 Christmas TV classics in a collectors case along with a 20 song sing-a-long CD. And for 25 bucks that is a deal you can't beat. That's roughly 5 bucks a show not including the CD. I got this set just so my 5 year old can grow up watching some of the "good" Christmas shows that I did.
