I'm not big on anime, but watching one episode got me hooked.  The voices, the animation, the story, the characters and the music all blend so seamlessly that it is a joy to watch Samurai Champloo.

Each and every episode just engrosses you deeper and deeper into the story line leaving you wanting for more.
