The picture quality is not very good.  It's like watching the videos on an old VHS tape taped off of television.  I've never seen a DVD in my DVD player look so not digital.  The selection is okay, the DVD opens playing a small clip of the Tears for Fears song "Head Over Heels" even though that video isn't on the set--but fear not, two Tears for Fears videos are here.  I bought this because I love the Level 42 video for "Something About You," and I figured this was my one shot to get it on DVD.  Buy this if you just must have it, the price is a bit much for such a short little collection, this should really be in the $12.99 or less range
