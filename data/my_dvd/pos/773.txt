I'm the kind of guy who takes out large clumps of grass with every swing no matter what club I use. It's so bad that my "so called" friends wouldn't even go to the range with me anymore because I embarrassed them too much. I was the butt of all the jokes at the office too. 
I already had a closet full of VHS tapes and a few DVDs, I've spend hundreds on my local "golf pro" and I've been reading magazines for years, but I just never could figure out the what, where and whys of my game. A friend recommended this set so I got one and it's been GREAT. I could easily understand and follow alone with the tips so well that I must have watched all the tips in one weekend.  And after only a few rounds I could finally start to understand what's going on with each drive, approach and putt I hit and that's helped me improve enough that my friends are playing with me again. 
In my opinion anyone would find these DVDs helpful. Even my local "golf pro" would benefit from this collection. However, I'm not sure I'll give away my new edge to all my "friends". At least until I can cut a few more strokes and they have to play catch up.
