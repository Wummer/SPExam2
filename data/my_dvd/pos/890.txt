I thought this DVD set was halarious!  I was hoping it wouldn't be the case where I saw it before, and remembered it to be funnier than it really was.  But that was not the case.  It truely was one of the funniest seasons of a comedy show I've ever seen!

I wonder if the cast has some sort of deal with Sprite, though, because you see so many current and former cast members from this show, in those commercials for Sprite.

Anyone care to comment on this?

My favorite skits are probably the Movie satires, and the one with Michael Jackson doing an infomercial is halarious!  I also like the Rap Video, with Ice Cube in prison, doing a song about acting, etc.  Just phenomenally halarious!
