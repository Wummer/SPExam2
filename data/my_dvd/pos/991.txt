An exercise in self-aggrandizement, but done so well it's forgivable. Set in London circa 1910, Chaplin plays an aging music hall comedian who once made audiences laugh but is now over the hill. One day as he stumbles home drunk, he smells gas, and rescues a young girl (Claire Bloom) from a suicide attempt. He nurses her back to health and sees to it that she resumes her dancing career. Between being philosophical about life and keeping his own career afloat, Chaplin performs a couple of old routines from the past, including a great sketch with Buster Keaton in which he plays the fiddle and Keaton the piano (it was both their swan songs). The movie is autobiographical and reeks of self-importance, with a number of references to Chaplin's carrer in pictures alluded to. But there's intelligence, too, and not a little sentimentality (what Chaplin picture doesn't contain this?), but Chaplin is such a demanding master that there isn't a moment of sloughing off or cheapness. Chaplin did everything, from writing the script to composing the music, and all of it is touched with genius. Made in 1952, the movie, amazingly, was not seen in Hollywood until 1972.
