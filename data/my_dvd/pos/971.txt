This film burns the screen with power, sensitivity, unbreakable bonds and emotional connections that will blow your mind. Jolie and Burress shine in Foxfire in a way that you'll never forget. Every woman has been a girl, and, even if they store their feelings deep inside, they have to wish they had spent a few months like these girls. I know I do. But even guys have to relate to the realistic rebellious and connected spirit these girls reflect on-screen. Every character is well-developed. I wish I could change the ending of the movie, but that ending is what keeps things real. This movie is definitely a treasure
