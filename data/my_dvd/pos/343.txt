Peirce really suprised me in this movie.  He was always so "pretty" in his movies, he showed that he can play "dirty".  An unlikely "friendship" developes between a regular guy and a hired killer.  Pierce, the hired killer, is getting older and less steady on the trigger, could it be that years of murdering is weighing heavy on his concience, or that he is close to his retirement years and dosen't have a  real friend in this whole stinkin' world because of the business he's in.  Either way, he's like a man in a desert who forgot to bring water.  Unusual buddy film, but, it works!  Enjoy
