This animation is as hilarious as when it was first aired, maybe even more so as the careers of some of those who sat on the good doctor's couch have blossomed eg David Cross, who you may remember from such shows as Arrested Development. Even Ray Romano is funny. The animation is great, especially the New York City scenes. Ben Katz is a scene stealer. I need to see 'Feng Shui' and 'Sticky Notes' on DVD please.
