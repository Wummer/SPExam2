What a splendid teacher is this! A soothing, captivating movie. The students are most endearing.
I found it interesting that, in the special features interview with the guy who made this movie, he refers to the teacher as "the teacher" and not by his name, Georges Lopes. This moviemaker appears to be of the opinion that there are a lot of teachers who could have filled this role as well, or nearly as well. Well let me tell you, he is wrong. This teacher is special. There are not very many teachers as patient and diplomatic and considerate on this entire planet as Georges Lopez
