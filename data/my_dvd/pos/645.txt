I have loved this movie since I first it back in the early 1990's. In all honesty it is pretty crudy but that's what I love about it. The music is fantastic and the costumes are unique. Divine truly shines as he usually does in any roles he played in and Ricki Lake was perfect for the role. Link is pretty hunky too.....
