I wouldn't write yet another review of War and Peace if I didn't have something new to say about it, namely, War and Peace and War by Peter Turchin. Near the end of Turchin's book, about bringing the scientific method to the rise and fall of empires, he quotes extensively from the parts of Tolstoy's War and Peace. Tolstoy, with his ratio analysis of various Napoleon Grand Arme metrics to Russian army metrics, was grappling with a theory of mathematical history well over a hundred years ahead of his time. Pick up Turchin's deep book, and afterwards read War and Peace, paying particular attention to Turchin's and Tolstoy's ideas. You will never see historical dynamics the same again.

Sincerely,

Alex Alaniz

PS--Read the book--the movie isn't so good--and please see the reviews of my own strong science fiction book: Beyond Future Shock about the near-terms perils and promise of advanced bio/nano technology in a world still roiled with Middle Age religious conflict and ever growing extreme wealth gradients
