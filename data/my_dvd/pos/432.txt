I first viewed this film with a friend, in my home.  He and I are both lovers of beautiful music and art.  This film satisfies both categories.  The score is absolutely magnificent and the views of Venice, beautiful.  The acting (by main character Dirk Bogard)is subtle but effective.  We found this film to be a totally soul-satisfying experience.
