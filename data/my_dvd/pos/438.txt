I was leaning towards giving it only three stars because it has certain weaknesses.  But then I saw the ending, and it was a beautiful one.  It always makes me happy to see love onscreen.

The side story of a jealous rival geisha constantly hurting our hero was annoying.  There really wasn't any reason for it.

Another part of the story I found annoying was the lack of communication between the main characters.  Our hero was giving one man all the signals that she was interested, but she in fact was interested in a different man, who she wasn't communicating with at all.

I don't like having to witness problems that make no sense to me.

But then came that surprise ending, so warm and affectionate.  That was nice
