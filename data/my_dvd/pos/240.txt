From the Sisyphean (say what?) misadventures of a kind of black Laurel and Hardy duo (Anthony Anderson and Lahmard J. Tate) who steal an ATM machine with no money in it that they can't open, to the white dude who thinks he's black, to Cedric the Entertainer who thinks that Rosa Parks got too much credit for parking her butt on the bus, to sexy and saucy Eve who always loves the wrong guy, this is one fine piece of entertainment.  And Ice Cube as Calvin who owns the shop ain't so bad himself, although he sure has to frown a lot.

Well, he's got troubles right here in the Windy City.  He's always got an entrepreneurial scheme up his sleeve that just doesn't quite work out which causes him to fall behind in his property taxes.  Now this might not be such a big deal but the barbershop has been in his family for three generations and it serves as a kind of neighborhood club where people can hang out and shoot the breeze.  It's a beloved kind of place.  Enter Lester Wallace the loan shark with muscle who makes Calvin an offer he can't refuse.  Well, he does refuse it or at least he tries, but Wallace ain't the kind of dude to take a refusal.

Can Calvin save the barbershop?  That's the question of the main plot line, but what really makes this movie such a treat are the barbershop mini-stories that are neatly tied together and the fine repartee.  And what makes THAT work is that everything in the film is seen from a point of view inside the black community and not from somebody else looking in (which never works, but is often tried).					
Add a warm and redemptive ending, and there ain't nobody cryin'.

But see this for Tim Story who directed and got it all right, and for Mark Brown, Don D. Scott and Marshall Todd who wrote the neat and very funny script
