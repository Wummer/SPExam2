If there was ever a movie that exposed the hypocrisy and meanness in people, this would be it!  Mrs. O'Hara, beautifully played by Mia Farrow, doesn't trust Edwina, the new beauty that's come to town.  The two battle it out, with Edwina coming out the loser in the end.  Or does she?  If I said any more, I'd be spoiling the story.  Just watch this movie, and enjoy.  Things are never what they seem, and I promise the ending will be worth staying for
