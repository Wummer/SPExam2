This amazed me when it first came out and still has that capability.  The combination of puppets and live action works really well, David Bowie is wonderful, and, all in all, it's a great family film.  When I gave it to my two granddaughters, ages 8 A 4, they watched it wide-eyed and a little bit scared. But then they watched it at least once a day for the next week
