This movie I consider to be akin to 'Vertigo' by Alfred Hitchcock. The pace is a little on the slow side with a lot of non-verbal action pulling the story along. It also mimics 'Rear Window' in that the main character witnesses a murder. In this case though, he was set up to be the witness. DePalma seems to have taken these themes and added some very strong satire.
He slams the porn industry in some very funny ways. You will have to watch and giggle along with some of these unforgetable scenes.
What I liked mostly about this movie was that it kept you guessing until the end. I don't want to give away too much here, but a clever use of 'Hollywood Hijinks' and the line 'Don't believe everything you see' fit with the story very well.
'Postcards from the edge' was the only strong movie that showed just how deceptive hollywood can be. In this film, DePalma shows how deadly and confusing it can be.
As in 'Dressed to Kill', DePalma relies on non-verbal acting to carry the story, and quite successfully too. The scene begins when Craig Wasson leaves the house he is sitting to follow who he thinks he's been watching though a telescope. The scene is carried through a mall and then to a beach. I believe it's about 20 minutes. Played out well with body language and facial expressions, this scene couldn't work any other way.
Like 'Vertigo', this movie seems to be drawn out somewhat. Maybe too much detail, not sure. I found myself becoming a little impatient at times for the story to continue.Not many movies attempt this slower approach, or do it in a way that makes it work.
All in all, definitely a must see. Keep in mind, the action is a bit slow at times.
Melanie Griffith appears here and does a great job in her role, as do the other actors. Filming, camera angels and use of props all work well. The plot is complex. This is a must see for suspense/murder mystery fans
