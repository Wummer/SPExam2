Lemon and Curtis are a great team - "Some Like It Hot" and "The Great Race."  In this movie we have great melodrama and the ageless story of boy meets girl (Natalie Wood) and she catches him.  The star-studded cast is enhanced by the superb acting of Peter Falk in one of his great comic roles, the hapless Maximillian always catching the short end of the stick by his perpetually out-of-sorts boss, the permanently crabby Professor Fate (Lemon).  Curtis does what he does best - looks dashing and debonoir in a role so familiar to him he could phone it in.  This DVD is a collector and one of my all-time top ten favorites
