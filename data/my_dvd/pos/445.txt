I thought Beavis and Butthead changed America. Their stupidity was a influence of a generation. I, sadly, was not allowed to watch the show when it was on TV (I was a child and in my elementary school years at the time), and because I actually rather watch the episodes instead of having to watch music videos within the episode (just like the duo themselves, they hate a lot of music videos but watch them just to critize them and I don't care for music videos), I really love the show. However, like other people who also liked the show, I have to agree with them to release all of the episodes (for goodness sake! I can't believe they didn't put in the Customers Suck episode because that was hysterical and the only one I have ever seen when the show was on TV) because we want to see and have all of the episodes, not just 80% of them and never get to see the other ones. I guess this is still recommended but remember, we all should fight back and get the remaining episodes back (even if they have a lost episodes collection I don't care, the people want them and Mike Judge is refusing to give us them!
