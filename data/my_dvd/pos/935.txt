I HAVE TO AGREE COMPLETELY WITH THE REVIEWER: "MKSONIC50". I READ HIS REVIEW OF "PLAY IT AGAIN SAM" THE SCENE WHERE WOODY ALLEN TRIES TO BE COOL AND COMPOSED WHEN INTRODUCED TO A LADY AND HE, INSTEAD OF SOUNDING ANYTHING LIKE ENGLISH, ONLY GROWLS. 
   I RECENTLY FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS MOVIE BECAUSE ALL I COULD THINK WAS OF THAT SCENE THAT I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE IT CAME FROM. 
I HAVE TO REPEAT THAT: "MKSONIC50" IS RIGHT ON THE MONEY. THAT WAS THE BEST COMICAL SCENE EVER.
