Other People's Money is a wonderful movie, full of smart dialogue, good music, and a terrific Danny DeVito performance.   DeVito is his usual funny, and easy-going self, while Gregory Peck is a strong-willed patriarch.  Very good stuff there.  The weakest performance is from Penelope Ann Miller, who isn't really convincing as the corporate attorney, but the material is so good that it saves the movie.  This is a 5 star film, however, it loses a 1/2 star, because of the last scene, which feels a bit tacked on.  Otherwise, a smart and funny film from the director of Moonstruck
