Jason X (as in Friday the 13th Part 10) sheds light on a familiar, though not too friendly, face: that of Jason.  A "miracle of science," Jason, is to be transported from a maximum-security facility to a research lab.  The transfer goes awry and he's once again up to no good before being cryogenically suspended. 
Things become a bit complicated when in the year 2455 a spaceship arrives from Earth II (!) and revives the masked lunatic...
The plot, the setting, the acting, and the dialogues are all very good.
It's just too bad the cutest girl gets whacked first... 
In a nutshell, Jason X is a movie definitely worth watching, as it will provide for an evening's entertainment, as long as you're in that kind of a mood.
