I'm not a big fan of Tom or Demi, and Jack even wears out his welcome in some films, but not here. The supporting roles are superbly done, the tension in the plot is sustained well until the end, and when this shows up on cable TV I almost always watch it again for a half-hour or so. Here you find soldiers and the law and political correctness in conflict, and that reflects a lot of real life in the USA during the past four years. I enjoy the script, because it demonstrates how brain power sometimes wins out over brute force.
