Known to all,  this is the story of Dorothy Gale and her  journey to the magical land of Oz. She meets a Scarecrow who needs a brain, a Tin Man who wants a heart, and a cowardly lion who desperately needs courage.  The most popular film of all time , seen by over a billion people. It's timelessness is proof enough of its value . Certainly flawed when scrutinized and written about for 56 years, but still most beloved. In 1998 rereleased on the big screen: magic. And admittedly the most important film of my life: As a child I was obsessed with the film and only a little less now
