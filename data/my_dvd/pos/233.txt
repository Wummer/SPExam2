Since I've already reviewed and bought both of these as separate items, I'm not gonna repeat anything about each show (see individual reviews for that).  I will just rehash what I have all along.  Despite its missing pieces from the book, the Original is still 5 star material.  The "in betweener" is only worth it's value because it is a disc copy (as opposed to a tape copy).  My advice, buy the Original separately, and read the book to get the "real missing years".  If you are building a library of "ALL Richard Chamberlain", then buy both or this combo.  But be prepared to be disappointed in what the alleged "Missing Years" has to offer (again see separate review)
