I have absolutely no idea how to properly describe this movie. I just know that I had to buy it b/c I rented it so often. Napolean is such a loser. His brother Kip could have a huge "L" on his own forehead.
They have a pet llama named Tina. Watching this movie brought back all of my akward teen years. Agh! Also made me feel a LOT prettier and smarter than I thought I was. In the end, though, they all win. Kip is especially transformed.
