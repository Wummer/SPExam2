It's so silly how Michael Moore is criticized purely based on what trashy Fox News watchers see on TV.  They claim that his works are fictious anti american jabble, when in reality he encourages people to pirate the movie A then goes on tour giving speeches full of well researched facts FOR FREE.  Clearly, this man is doing it all for the money.

If his words are so insincere, why has the president not sued him for slander?
And why can't anyone slamming the movie ever make any specific reference? It's always a general statement about michael moore being one explictive or another, and never about something he actually says.  Could it be, maybe, that they don't even know why they hate him
