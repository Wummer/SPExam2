Wow, I was so excited to see this available on DVD. This is from the era of cartoon geniuses. These cartoons are good for all ages and will never go out of fashion. I can not wait to have kids and show this to them. It beats the violence and tone of cartoons today. This is my choice for a cartoon lovers collection a MUST HAVE. Enjoy
