I am a huge Chef! fan. I have been watching the show since it was on BBC America and my local PBS station. I was excited to find that the "Complete Collection" was finally available on DVD. I got the package and could not wait to start watching the show and that is when the dissappointment sat in. I realized that shows were missing from the "Complete Collection" like: Divorice?, Gareth's Father and the Christmas Special "A Bird in the hand". Can someone please tell me how this can be the "Complete Collection" with those episodes ommitted from the DVD?
