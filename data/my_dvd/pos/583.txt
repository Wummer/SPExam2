Leftist-Anti Establishmentarian
Michael Moore is mad as hell and
he's not taking it anymore as his
smalltown America, Flint, MI has
just lost 30,000+ jobs as greedy
G.Motors Exects move plant to Mexico
and put above mentioned thousands
out of work. Moore does a good job
of keeping the subject serious for
a change. Other good Moore films
included Fahrenheit 911 and The
Big One. Others he's done get too
far into his leftist politics which
I am (far-political-middle/Populist)
am not into. Good job here, Michael
