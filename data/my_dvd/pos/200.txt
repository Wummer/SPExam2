You know you have a hit on your hands when even your boys want to sit and watch this wonderful video over and over again! I pass them walking around the house humming the music and even asking for art materials to try some of the things they have seen in the video. Best educational video I have seen for motivating the creative side of children and it has motivated me to buy other Brainy Baby videos. Try it-you won't be dissapointed!
