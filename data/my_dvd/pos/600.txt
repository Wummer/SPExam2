We just got this DVD last week, but ever since that time it has remained in the DVD player and has been viewed at least a dozen times by my three year old daughter, Cassidy. She LOVES this DVD and all the planets that come to life.  She sings along and has really learned her planets.  The songs are top notch.  The DVD is enjoyable for adults, even after ten viewings when most kid videos would become painful.  A+++++++++++
