Oh, wow. I can't complain much about this. Although some things I didn't notice explained and the ending was a little rushed, this was still very effective on me. It may've been better as a game or not, I don't know. There were several times where this made me so emotional I wanted to cry for the characters. The silent and melancholy Kaze, the hilarious and deranged Cid or the hyperactive and cheerful twins. Even for the short time you know them, they grow on you and what becomes of some of them is just extremely heartwrenching. I know some people may not be satisfied with this, but I was. I recommend it
