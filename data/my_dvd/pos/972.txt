Foxfire is an excellent movie that demonstrates the friendship of 5 girls who learn how to stand up for themselves in this world. The inspiration for their newfound rebellion is from the 5th girl that brings the 4 others together, Legs, played phenomenally by Angelina Jolie. I must say this: I really don't care much for Ms. Jolie, and perhaps the media is to blame by making stories like her A Billy Bob and their whole blood thing the top news story, more recently her husband-stealing with Brad Pitt, but I cast aside those feelings for an hour and 40 minutes and found myself absolutely loving her performance. If you are like me and don't like her, please do give her a chance in this film. She's astonishingly good and I kept having to remind myself it was Angelina. 

As a matter of fact, the entire cast turns in memorable performances. I think this is a great movie for women to watch but I don't know if men will enjoy it quite as much. I did see one male reviewer claiming he didn't find it to be just a chick flick, but he might be the minority. Guy or gal, if the story sounds intriguing to you, and it really is, then Foxfire is definitely worth checking out. I give it only 4 stars simply because the character of Maddy (wonderfully played by Hedy Burress) has a boyfriend but she nevers breaks up with him and he kind of fizzles into the background. Left me wondering why he was even in the movie to begin with, but that's my only criticism.

At this price, it's a fabulous addition to your collection, though believe it or not, the low price right here on Amazon has been beaten by Wal-Mart...it's in the $5.50 bin. This is a great movie that reminds us that sometimes people will make it difficult for you to do the right thing, but you must believe in yourself and stand for what you believe. Definitely recommended
