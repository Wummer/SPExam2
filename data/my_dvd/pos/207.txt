What a complilation!  Much better than what availiable out there on him. It was good to see some of the old clips from the Sixties of Marvin.  I know that there's got to be more. I especially liked the clip with Tammi Terrell.  I was great to see her flirting with him while they were performing.  That's the stuff of legends.  I hope Motown continues this series of DVD's with their other acts.
