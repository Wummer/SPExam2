Unfairly overlooked in the early 90's for rideing at the tale end of the last wave of 80's slasher films 'POPCORN(1991)' is a damn good little slasher flick with a somewhat dry but exceptable endind,some decent acting,a ludicrous story,some good dark atmosphere,decent kills,plenty of cheese A a pretty creepy villain. The parody of a slasher film being set in a movie theatre is excellent A Wes Craven A the makers of 'SCREAM' owe alot to this little known gem for slurping up some inspiration
