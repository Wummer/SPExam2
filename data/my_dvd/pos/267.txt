This one is a classic not only to the general public but among submarine sailors as well.   It is considered the greatest of all submarine movies and with good reason.   Almost the entire plot is onboard and underway.  The tensions that rise from long periods at sea and personality clashes among a large group of strong-willed and independently-minded men is real.  It is a must have for the second world war movie buff and submarine movie collectors.  The acting is superb and perfectly cast in each role.  The dramatic interaction of the characters will keep this one a classic for ages to come
