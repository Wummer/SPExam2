Boy, did this movie suck at the beginning! And boy, did it just get better and better from there on in. Even the Oriental humor, which is usually so awful, was actually funny at times. The action sequences, while a little too often fanciful, were very impressive, even innovative. Chow is a talented guy. Having seen this I'm interested to see what his earlier work is like. If you like martial arts/action/weird comedy, you'll love this
