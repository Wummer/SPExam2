To be honest, I think I found this by looking at listmania lists when I was searching for other anime titles. I had never heard of it, but the reviews seemed good and the price was more than attractive so I decided to give it a shot, although I didn't really expect too much. Boy am I glad I bought it! The only thing I didn't like about it was that there were only 4 episodes. I know this review says pretty much the same thing as all the other reviews, but I figured I should throw in my two cents anyway
