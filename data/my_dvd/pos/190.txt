THIS IS A GREAT DVD ABOUT CAGE MATCHES. IT HAS A LOT OF VIOLENT MATCHES ON IT AND A LOT OF CLASSIC CAGE MATCHES. BUT THE REASON WHY I I AM GIVING THIS 4 STARS IS BECAUSE MOST OF THE MATCHES ON HERE ARE JIPS.(MATCHES JOINED IN PROGRESS.) IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF ALL THE MATCHES WERE FULL. BUT ON DISC 2 IT HAS 7 FULL MATCHES BUT THAT IS STILL NO ENOUGH MATCHES. THIS DVD IS WORTH A BUY BUT REMEBER ONLY 7 MATCHES ARE FULL
