I have been a fan of CSI since the first season has come out. I am an avid collector of DVDs and I'm way behind, I'm on another show right now as we speak. Anyway, I love the sound, and the special features are always low, but I don't mind that. There is just one thing that I did not like. Part of the cover case on my season four dvd, came off. It still fits into my DVD collection, and I obviously won't buy another copy because the DVD's are working fine, but the plastic may come into a problem
