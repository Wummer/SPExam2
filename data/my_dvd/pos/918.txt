Certainly the best kung-fu movie I've ever seen, Kung Fu Hustle is loaded with effects and humor, and stunning fight sequences to boot.  Try and watch any regular martial arts movie afterward and all you can do is yawn, even the great Bruce Lee is tired and played-out in comparison to Kung Fu Hustle.  The movie continues to top itself throughout, with an escalation of fight scenes that peaks with the hero jumping higher than the clouds, seeing Buddha, lightly stepping off a bird, and plunging to earth to deliver a blow capable of knocking a fifty-foot hole in a building!  This aint just wire-fu, it's wired-fu with hilarious weirdness.
