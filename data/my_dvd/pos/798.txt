I don't usually like romance films, but 2046 is brilliant!  

A mind trip AND sensual candy!

If you have a short attention span, you will not appreciate this work of art.  But if the first half draws you in, the second half will BLOW YOUR MIND!

This is genius!

This is art!

Full of colorful symbolism
