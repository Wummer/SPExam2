I was not privy to the world of Christopher Guest until a friend of mine told me that if I liked `Drop Dead Gorgeous' then I would flip over any of Guest's films.  The video store only had one in, and that was `Best in Show' and I'm SOOOOO glad they had it.  This film has to be one of the funniest films I've ever seen, a complete riot from beginning to end.  As a true `mockumentary' every scene is shot pretty much adlib and you can sense the intended on the spot dialog as everyone is being interviewed and or followed around to `document' the Mayflower Dog Show.  The film follows a group of dog owners as they get ready to show their little bundles of joy.  There's Jennifer Coolidge and Patrick Crenshaw play Leslie and Sherri Ann Ward Cabot (total spoof on the whole Anna Nicole Smith scandal), owners of a prize winning poodle who's won `Best in Show' 2 years straight, and with the help of lesbian handler Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch) hopefully she'll win for a third.  Then there's Harlan Pepper (Christopher Guest himself), a southern bloodhound owner who dreams of being a ventriloquist.  And there's power comic couple Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara who play the Flecks, owners of a terrier, who struggle with Mrs. Flecks long line of previous lovers.  There are lovers Stefan A Scott (Michael McKean A John Michael Higgins) who spoil their Shih Tzu's and each other.  But finally we have the star couple of the show, the neurotic Meg and Hamilton Swan (Parker Posey A Michael Hitchcock), owners of Beatrice, and beautiful yet disturbed and `negative' Weimaraner who's been traumatized by the sight of this young couple having sex.  Their antics, arguments and strange affection to their dog is some of the funniest scenes in the whole film, and their chemistry is pure brilliance.  The film brilliantly pokes fun at a sport taken WAY TO SERIOUS, and with Fred Willard as the commentator of the show the film is filled with barrel rolls from start to finish
