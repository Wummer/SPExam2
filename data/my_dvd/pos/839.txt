Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn and a marvelous supporting cast that includes James Coburn (and a "killer" soundtrack by Henry Mancini) deserve much better treatment than they get in this no-frills DVD with absolutely no special features.

This comic murder mystery shows off its stars to their finest --in spite of a less than admirable film transfer.  It's all thanks to the great performances, tongue in cheek direction and witty screenplay.  Hopefully a better quality and enhanced DVD version will replace this one in your film library.  Nonetheless, "Charade" remains a charming and timeless classic
