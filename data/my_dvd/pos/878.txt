As a moderate skiier, and a filmmaker myself, this hits it home for me.  Warren Miller films are always shown locally, and there's hardly anything imaginable that could make me miss his new movie every year.
Not being a Heavy Metal fan, historically the music tends to be distracting, alas this (past) year's edition "Storm" had just the right amount of pizazz and flare to make it my favorite yet.  There are moments nearly every year that I take home with me, but Storm was filled with the most amazing skiing, some of the most unique locations, and might add the most exhilarating editing I've seen in quite a while!  Kudos to you folks!
If you can appreciate the splendor of mountain island skiing that harldy anyone on earth has even seen, let alone skiied, then this DVD will certainly expediate your plans for skiing this coming season.  You might not go to South Georgia Island, but there's plenty of skiing nearby...just roadtrip and split a cabin :
