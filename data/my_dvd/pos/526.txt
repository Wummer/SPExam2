Half Light is a movie my wife would like, if I can convince her that it's not too scary for her.  She is the most timid of movie goers, and refuses to watch horror movies with me.  But Half Light is a ghost story very much in the classic sense:  there are some scares, but at the most tepid edge of today's horror.  The movie is much more about the grief of a mother (have the Kleenex box close by), and has a big love story (with running horses on a romantic beach with a lighthouse; ugh) in the middle of it.  Just the kind of thing my wife might like, when she's willing to see something on her scary side.  Unfortunately for me, this is not my kind of movie at all.  

Even so, it was well made.  It was well acted.  The English locations were impressively beautiful.  The story was interesting, and had a good plot twist at the end.  Ah what the heck; I guess I liked it after all
