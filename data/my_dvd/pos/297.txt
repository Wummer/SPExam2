Okay,the only real extras on the DVD is a theatrical trailer for the film and some biographical information on the movie and it's stars,but Warner Bros. gets a five star rating for great picture and sound and the option of BOTH Standard Full Frame and Widescreen versions on one disc!!! This movie is an absolute classic!!! And it's great to have it on DVD!!! One of the great "men in chains" films!!! The great cast includes Paul Newman,George Kennedy(in his oscar winning role!),Wayne Rogers,Strother Martin,Joe Don Baker,Ralph Waite,and many other classic character actors!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A
