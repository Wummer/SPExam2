This movie was alright.  I give it five stars for being artsy, quirky.
It makes Gay love look systematically funny, and easily made fun of.  Even people with AIDS deserve a better look at their lives.  I do not have HIV/AIDS but have lost friends over it.  This is a movie for those who either want a good laugh, or a good cry.
I know of nobody who really acts as these characters do.  I doubt it goes on in New York Citys Manhattan either.
Purchase this if your just wanting to add to your GLBT VHS, or DVD collection
