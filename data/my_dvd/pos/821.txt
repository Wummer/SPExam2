Scenes from a Marriage is a Swedish film by Ingmar Bergman. To me, this is one of the best films ever. It not only captures a great story, but it is done so well.
What makes the movie so great is that you can relate to how they feel, act, and generally take care of issues.
This isn't one of those American films where a person breaks off with someone and they start yelling and throwing objects at them.
In here, as he is telling his wife about this other lover, she is without emotions, just staring off, with no real reactions whatsoever, a way most would respond.
This is basically a 3 or 5 hour film about a wife who believes their marriage is great/perfect. It is later that she finds outs that perhaps, the marriage isn't so great when she listens to a patient decribe her marriage and why she wants a divorce.
There, the wife wants to plan a trip with her husband and try to improve their marriage. He later says he's been with a woman for a while now, and shortly there after, leaves her.
After a year of so, they get together to sign the divorce papers, which turns out rough at the end.
After some time, they get together again, and in some way, fall in love once again, even though both are married to other people.
There, the movies ends.
Great film! Hard to watch some american films now, because most just seem horrible, and in ways, corny. I'm glad I got to see a great film like this.
