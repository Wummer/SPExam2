There isn't one wasted second in this film.  Not one!!!  You'll be sucked in, and surprised, within the first two minutes, and there's very little dialogue so you need not worry about too much subtitle reading.  You can tell there's a lot of influence from American film noir in this film, but "Le Samourai" takes it to a level of perfection.  I wish some of the folks that throw their good money towards bad modern action flicks would take the time to watch "Le Samourai" they just might discover a thing or two about how it could really be done.  Brilliant
