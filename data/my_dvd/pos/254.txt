Well I thought it was going to stop at Volume 1.  But, I guess it didn't.
But, I am amazed that some of the cast is still living.  I can't believe that Skip Hinnant who plays Fargo North Decoder has got gray hair and still seems to be in good health.  Not to mention Jim Boyd who plays J. Arthur Crank is also still alive but on the heavy side.  As for Judy Graubart, I can't believe how old and skin and bones she is.  She must've been the oldest actor on the cast because now you should see her today.  Hattie Winston poor thing, I think she must've suffered a stroke or something cause I've noticed in her interviews she twitches every now and then.  We hardly ever see Morgan Freeman in any of these interviews because he's a big time busy actor.  But, I loved the show and am glad they brought this collection together in another set of DVD's from a show I grew up watching when I was 10.  Luis Avalos who I loved watching not just on the Electric Company but in his acting career in movies like Stir Crazy and then a full role in Dom DeLuise's HOT STUFF along with his family.  Luis still looks the same but has gained some weight too like Jim Boyd.  It is great that the graphics and color of the sets on each show brings back memories and the songs they sang too brought back some memories.  It is also hard to believe that the voices you hear on the cartoon skits like Letterman are Zero Mostel, Gene Wilder, Joan Rivers, and Mel Brooks.  You wouldn't have thought that there voice talents would be a credit to their success today.  Well now we have to get ready for Volume 3.....will there be? ......Let's hope so, cause I will surely buy it!
