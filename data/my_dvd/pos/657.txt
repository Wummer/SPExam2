This movie is going to bring you down.  That's a fact.  But it's hard to deny this movie all the praise it deserves.

A classic tale about men who served in one of the most treacherous environments ever known to man.  It's also hard not to come out of this without a lot of respect for the germans who served in the U Boat service
