Just behind WINGS OF DESIRE is Federico's masterpiece.
A true ICON.  8 1/2 not only resounds with my Italian Catholic 
upbringing as it displays in obvious detail the time-wasting 
progression of guilt and shame;  it commands me to again
possess the mantra quoted from WALL STREET:  "To be rich enough
not to waste time".
