I FIRST WATCHED THIS INCREDIBLE GROUP OF MUSICIANS I BELIEVE ON AUSTIN CITY LIMITS AND WAS TOTALLY TAKEN IN BY THE MAGIC THESE GUYS PERFORM ALONG WITH VERY, VERY GOOD CAMERA WORK WHICH COMPLIMENTED THEIR EVERY MOVE. PAT'S FASCIALS ARE CAPTURED INTENSLY AS WELL AS ALL OF THE MUSICIANS PERFECTIONISM..
  THE PERFORMANCE IS FLAWLESS AND YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF FEELING AS IF "YOU ARE HERE".  BRAVO!!
