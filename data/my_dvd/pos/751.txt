You should see this because it has an eary appearance by America (yes, peo-ple, that is HER real name) Ferarra!!!  WHo, you ask?? Oh (casually) only the star of UGLY BETTY.   (looks up, says ala Pulp Fiction) "Oh, do I have your attention now????  Also in this movie is Roary from GG (gilmore Girls for the ignorant).  The only thing I didnt like was the blonde who had sex with the older man, not only was it innapropriate, but also illegal!!!!  WSo, parents be aware of this if you're daughter's want to watch this movie.  It has sexual content!!!!  Especially if they are under age!  Now, peo-ple, I am a male and also over 18 so i can watch what I want, but I'm just saying that for young girls they shouldn't watch this one!!!  But we ALL can watch Ugly Betty!!!!
