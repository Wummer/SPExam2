When I first watched this TV movie, with an unusal turn by Lucille Ball as a homeless woman, I was touched by the grittiness she brought to the role, and her fearlessness at looking like an unvarnished "bag lady". Although definitely within the "TV movie" league, this film richly deserves to continue to be available for new viewers to enjoy
