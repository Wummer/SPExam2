This was truly a great piece of work and should be viewed by all.  It was a very sad day when the election was stolen from Mr. Gore, but this movie gave me a new realization. That being in office would have held this man back. His talent and passion truly shine through here and are very contagious. This is not a movie that leaves you feeling hopeless and wondering what you can do. Mr. Gore lists plenty of things we as individuals can start to do to make changes. He gives a website climatecrisis.net for more ideas and info.  If you think this might be too boring for your taste, give it a chance and watch it if only to see the giant jellyfish.

Thank you Mr. Gore and all of the people who helped you make this happen
