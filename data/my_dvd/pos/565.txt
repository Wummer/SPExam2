Couldn't believe that this was the same John Lithgow who starred in "Third Rock From the Sun", an hilarious comedy that ran for a few years on NBC.  John plays the ultimate bad guy seeking twisted revenge for being stopped in his tracks by Denzel's character.

Wasn't expecting much, but this movie was surprisingly entertaining.  Yes, it was a little violent, and some parts were a tad unbelievable, but overall, Denzel and John were worthy antagonists.  Boy, Denzel sure was gorgeous!!  Still is.
