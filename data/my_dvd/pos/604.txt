Its been a long time since I have laughed this much!!!! Getting down to "the nitty gritty" it is an enjoyable comedy.  The chemistry between Jack Black "Nacho" and Hector Jimenez "Esqueleto" is what makes the movie so funny. His accent was not Mexican but very funny. My family and I just loved the movie, which I think we have seen 5 times in the theatre
