From the Sociobiological aspect the movie conveys brilliantly how the husband that doesn't has access to its genetic children will resort to extreme violence. It also shows how parents are excited about courtship abilities of their young son (since a "Don-Juan" son can pass a lot of their genes with various women in his lifetime) . Eventually it shows how the aging parents cannot bare the pain from losing their only son, the only way by which they can pass their genes, so they resort to extreme violence, even if the  violence is somewhat spiteful: "If my son cannot pass my genes, your son who killed my son for a good genetic reason wouldn't be able to either" - that's the subconscious motivation for murder "conveyed" by the genes
