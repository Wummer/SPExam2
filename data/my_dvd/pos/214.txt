This DVD is explaining things better than the previous version, where there were lot of gaps in understanding some of the areas of quantum theory etc. 

Some of the theories are wonderfully animated and explained.  The crytal-photography on water meditated upon by the Japanese monk was especially awesome.

They have tried their best to explain stuff that cant be easily explained by the western(modern)science .... ofcourse.....it ends in letting you ponder....they have left most of it there.  There after one has to go into religion and spirituality - particularly one place where to begin looking for would be at the "Sanathana Dharma" teachings
