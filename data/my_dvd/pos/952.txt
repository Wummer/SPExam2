Most of this movie is terrible, but who's complaining?  The epically long "Begin the Beguine" is the climax of the movie A it makes the whole mess worthwhile.  The last 11 minutes of this movie are mind-blowingly great -- absolute perfection.  The sets, the cinematography, the costumes, the orchestrations A the extraordinary routine itself -- everything combines to make "Begin the Beguine" the most ravishing, glamorous black A white production number ever put on film.  It's Hollywood at its apogee, the quintessence of silver screen glamor.  

A few of the other numbers are fun: the first, "Don't Monkey with Broadway" is clever A pleasant; later on, Fred Astaire's lovely "I've Got My Eyes on You" is also winning:  a charming routine that he dances to a delightful, cheerful orchestration.  Some other numbers are worth seeing, as well, but "Begin the Beguine" outshines everything else in this picture.

In between the numbers, there's a lot of dreary silliness afoot.  Happily, DVD technology makes it easy to skip over the dross A go straight for the gold.

Eleanor Powell was a very odd actress.  She was rather pretty A decidedly perky (how much you go for perky will determine how agreeable you find her personality); she was also quite feminine.  Why, then, does she speak out of the side of her mouth like a gangster?  She often sounds like a distaff Edward G. Robinson ("Dat was SWELL, Johnny, SWELL! Nyah!").  But man oh man, could she dance!
