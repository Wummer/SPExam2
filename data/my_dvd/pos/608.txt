This DVD is the bomb! Why?  Prince puts on a show. From Morris Day and the Time- (a Must see) to the Lenny Kravitz and Prince Jam session. True Prince fans will love seeing his energy and creativity. 

Prince is a real performer who puts his heart and soul in every dance move and song. 

As for the spirituality aspect, I loved to see that side of him.
The song he sang was powerful and heartfelt. 

Get the DVD. You won't be disappointed
