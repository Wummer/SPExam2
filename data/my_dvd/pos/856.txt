I knew that I wanted this movie, but I had forgotten much of the plot.  It is a pleasure to view this one and recall that movies could be humorous without being decadent; that adventure could be portrayed without endless special effects or digital animation or dissonant "music"; and that the more leisurely pace was relaxing :-)  Suffice to say that both my wife and I found it very enjoyable! 

The extra clips were fascinating background on making of the movie:  one should not miss reviewing them.  The effort spent on the aircraft alone added a considerable touch of reality
