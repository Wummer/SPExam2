I really enjoyed this movie.  Rose McGowan did a great job as the villianess Debbie.  My favorite line from the movie "It's a family thing."  The movie was, in my opinion, a black comedy.  And Rose totally looked like trailer trash on her first day of school--brilliant!  You should definately watch this movie when you haven't got anything better to do
