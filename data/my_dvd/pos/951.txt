this dvd is the best one ive ever seen snoop put out. the concert footage and sound isnt the greatest but this dvd is so much more that i thought i was getting. Dont get me wrong the concert parts are so dope to hear my fav snoop classics and i was left with one question how did they get clearance from Suge to put out his Death Row classics, but this dvd shines as a replayable classic. You would be so so suprised at what is on this, see most people are happy getting a concert dvd like the up and smoke where snoop performs in one city, you watch it after fast forwarding through all the opening acts like westside connec and you dont have to watch it again for years...this is quite a different approach.  I was literally hurting from laughing so hard because this dvd gives you the bishop don juan, it gives you backstage, it gives you the norml conference...you cant even take it all in if you watched it once!  i say if you like snoop, if you like weed, if you like biatches and hiznoes, you got a winner with the puff puff pass
