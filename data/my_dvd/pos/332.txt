I bought this as a dvd for home use.  I won't repeat the story as others have done so already.  I loved the story.  The plot was well put together and solid.  The acting was wonderful.  I have watched it a couple of times now and enjoy it more each time I see it. I really am enjoying the fun of this film.  I'd suggest to folks to just relax and watch a terrific and humorous film.  It is made to be light with family values of what counts in life.    Tim did an outstanding job as he always does. The chasing scenes with Tim on all fours becoming a dog; the dog behaviors as a human had me rolling. It is one of the funniest films I've seen in a long time.  As an adult I loved it and would buy it again. I'm thrilled to see Disney making such terrific and wonderful films.  It was tastefully done.  The caged scenes were carefully done.  No bad language just a wonderful film that can be enjoyed as another eventual classic among the Disney films.  And no I didn't perceive this as a film geared toward small children.  Perhaps pre-teens and up would be my guess.  To demean the film based on the expectation that tiny children would appreciate the story is not realistic nor does it do justice for what the film is.  It is a wonderful film with a great storyline!!  corinn
