Where did this guy come from?  My daughter rented this Eddie Izzard DVD.  I was blind-sided with the sophisticated, mime-style humor of Eddie Izzard (is this his real name?  Is he really a "he"?).  From hearing about Genesis to wondering why Noah had to get two of everything... including ducks..., Eddie Izzard brought a unique perspective to comedy.  Nothing was off limits... the Queen Mother, Death, hopscotch, speed archeology, toasters, and Achilles.  It is all here!

Take special note of the set... very minimalist.  Izzard uses his talents to make you "see" what he is describing, without depending on props.  From swords to Hoovers, you will get his meaning.

Rated R for mild profanity, and I for irreligious
