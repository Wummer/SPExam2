This is a sad little gem of a movie.  I really liked that the plot explored more themes than just romantic love. The story had as much to do with issues of identity, community, and fidelity.  In my opinion, there were a few technical and narrative flaws that kept the film from attaining the level of greatness that it should have achieved, especially when considering the quality of the performances.  The slight quiver in Weisz's voice was right on target as was Perez's accent. The rest of the illustrious cast was more than capable. Considering the type of story and the setting, I can't help but think that a three-part mini-series would have been a more appropriate treatment than a feature film.  I emerged from watching the movie with a feeling  that there was a lot more to explore beneath the surface of each character
