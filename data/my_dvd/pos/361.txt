I love this series and plan to buy more.  It is well done.  The signs are separated so one can watch just one in a sitting, or watch the whole dvd.  The word is first shown, then a mom shows the sign, then kids demonstrate (including some use of the actual object, if appropriate).  My child and I have both picked up signs quickly from this DVD
