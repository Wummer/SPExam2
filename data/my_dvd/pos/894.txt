One of the best films I have seen: captures the lack of humanity and humanity of this world simaltaneously. Humanises conflict. Has the ability to make you laugh and cry. Draws attention to the plight of children and humanises the children of the Middle East. I would recommend this film to everyone with a conscience as essential viewing. Having said that, it did plunge me into depression so perhaps I should urge caution
