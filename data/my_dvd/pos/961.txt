Revenge, it's said, is a meal best served cold. The creepy, existential, ultra-violent OLDBOY (Tartan) takes that dish and smashes it in your face with raging.

Without explanation, Oh Dae-Su, a businessman with a family, is kidnapped and imprisoned in a dank, dirty room for 15 years.  Suddenly he's released, given money, a cell phone and nice clothes.  On his way to revenge, he discovers his kidnapper still has plans for him, and it's something worse than what's already happened.  Now he's got five days to find him and balance the books.
