the fifth installment of samurai champloo has proven, like the volumes before it, that good things come to those who wait. with masterful artwork, great music and action-packed scenes, samurai champloo has kept the industry alive. below are my ratings for the four episodes on this volume.


episode seventeen: lullabies of the lost verse2- the fans that watched volume four have been waiting for this episode: it finishes what volume four left unfinished. this episode reveals the fate of our heroes and if their fate brings them together again.
i rate this episode a 10/10. great episode nomatter how many times i watch it.

episode eighteen: war of the words- mugen is illiterate! as mugen finally comes to terms with this, fuu tries to fend off two crazy boys with the hots for her! and amidst this commotion, visits a grave of a man he had great respect for. 
i rate this episode 9/10

episode nineteen: unholy union- jin, mugen and fuu discover a fraud involving selling weaponry and the underground christians. intrigued? guess you gottta watch it! good episode.
i rate this episode a 7/10. it was quite funny, but there was less action and less plot compared to other episodes. still, a good thirty minutes.

episode twenty: elegy of entrapment verse1- it's happened again! this episode is one part of a two part episode on the end of this dvd. that means we are to be cliffhung once again. still, this is a really good episode.
i rate this episode a 10/10.


well, thats it for this review. check out my others for this series.
