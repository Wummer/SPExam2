An excellent movie about a smart conman who eventually ends up rendering his skills to the FBI. 

The movie is not just about this, but a lot of subtle things like the relationships between Abagnale and his dad.

Some of the scences were very well picturized
-The silent mutual giggle which Abagnale(Leonardo) and his dad exchange as they walk out from the School principal's office
-When Tom Hanks enquires with Abagnale's dad if he know where Leonardo is, his dad replies that 'If you had son, you will know that it is your son whom you love more than anything else'

Overall, it is one of the best movies I have seen. Everything in this movie deserves 5 stars
