This film was absolutely beautiful because of the location in which it was shot and the main characters.  However, its true appeal comes from the manner in which it portrays the desperation that comes from living a life which is less than truthful, the struggles involved in being true to oneself despite the consequences, and the difficulties that sometime occur when trying to figure out what is really important to your soul.  Although I have recommended this film to several people, I caution them that it can be pretty disturbing.  I thought about it for weeks after I saw it the first time, and it took me a while to get up the nerve to watch it again.  Definitely not a "light hearted" evening of entertainment
