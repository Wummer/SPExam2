It's interesting to read some of the other reviews. I can't understand how it could take a viewer two times to get through this enchanting movie. It's imaginative, as was "Nightmare Before Christmas", but goes beyond that movie with even better stop-action animation and a musical score that is richer and more moving. I loved "Nightmare", but Corpse Bride takes all the things I loved and made them better. The voices of all the actors ring true. The mood is gothic and yet comical. The score is rich and defines the movie perfectly. (The DVD allows you to watch the movie with only the music, and that's a real plus.)
