I ordered this guide so that I could understand all of the options and functions available on my new Nikon D200.  Since it is a video that I could watch, pause, then continue watching it was easy for me to understand. The explanations made a lot of sense.  There are lots of examples and exercises that help to explain not only how the D200 works but how to use the various functions to take better photos. I highly reccommend it
