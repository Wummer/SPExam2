"Monk" is quite an interesting show. It is about this character named Adrian Monk (played by Tony Shalhoub, "Wings"), who is an obsessive compulsive detective with many phobias. He is also incredibly intelligent; he can literally solve any kind of case rather quickly, provided that he has all the right clues. The most interesting aspect of this is that one never knows when Monk might have an idea on what the mystery might be until he utters four immortal words, which, for some of the most intense cases, will really shock the audience: "I've solved the case." However, for some reason, the best part always seems to be when he says, "Here's what happened."

When it comes to the scenes involving murder cases, it must be known that the antagonists of some episodes can get very, very brutal. They will do things like whack people against the head with crowbars, slice up their bodies with chainsaws, smash their hands with car doors, and sometimes, they will even try drowning them, and like the antagonists of "MacGyver," they are not afraid to use guns, if necessary.

The acting is phenomenal especially by Tony Shalhoub and Ted Levine (Capt. Stottelmeyer). The photography and cinematography are also well done and enhances each scene in each episode. Finally, this DVD is practically perfect in picture and sound quality. It has extras like featurettes and you have the option of listening to it in three different languages; English, Spanish, and French. I found it all interesting. In conclusion, this TV show has it all: good background music, great dialogue, interesting stories, good acting, and interesting cinematography.

The KAB score: 8.9 super
