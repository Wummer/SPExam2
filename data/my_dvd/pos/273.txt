This is a GREAT movie!  I would encourage EVERYONE to see this one... even if you have never even known someone with this condition, you should buy this movie.  There are not enough movies like this one out there.  We need to support this type of film making.  I don't want to give the plot of the movie away, so I won't go into great detail.  Watching this movie gives me hope.  Hope for so many people out there with this illness.  Hope that they or someone close to them will watch this and will give this diet a try.  Don't give up hope.  Thank you to whomever made this film possible.
