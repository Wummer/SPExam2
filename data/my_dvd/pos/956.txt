I had often heard about Degrassi: The Next Generation. I went on to the show's website often, even though I didn't get the channel it shows on. I knew as much about the show that everyone else did, and I didn't even see the show. So after a year or two of trying to figure out how to I could see the show, I heard that they were making a DVD, and I was so excited! 

I ordered it on ebay a few months after it came out, and it was fairly priced. I watched all of it in a day, and I was ecstatic. This show is all about what it is really like being a teen. Nothing fake, but not over-dramatic. Giving life lessons on everything, like internet relationships, the effects of using ecstasy, presssure (beer), family, rumors, first dates, and all sorts of things. Season One is especially perfect for prettens and early teenagers because it is based around a group of 7th and 8th Graders.

Of course, through the Seasons, the characters face changes and more dramatic situations, but somehow, there is always a Season for teens and Preteens of every age to relate to. And that's what everybody likes about the show. 

This DVD also includes auditions for most cast members, which are fun to watch, bloopers and deleted scenes, which add more to the episode, and a karaoke of the theme song which is also very fun. With cast and characters biographies, you can tell that the creators of the DVDs put as much into them as possible, and it pays off.
