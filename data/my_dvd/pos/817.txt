The great thing about the Naruto series is it has an involved, ongoing storyline without taking itself too seriously. The episodes are well translated and the actors well chosen. It has some suspense and alot of comedy and for older children it has a nice message of never giving up on your dreams.

My small gripes are that for some reason Naruto has the catch phrase of "Believe it!", and it gets dropped into places that it doesn't make any sense, but it's a small problem.

Also the extras you get are really fun and high quality. This is a great package for the hardcore fan and newcomer alike
