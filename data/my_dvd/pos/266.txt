Clueless has been released on DVD before, with nothing more than two theatrical trailers as bonus features. In 2005, for its 10th anniversary, Paramount finally released a great, if not cheesily named, DVD edition of this 90's teen comedy classic, with such quotable lines as "You're a virgin who can't drive" and "As if!"

The transfer on this DVD is AWESOME. It's very clean, sharp, and clear. I don't remember any issues on the past DVD, but if there were any, it seems like they were cleared up for this release.

The bonus features are likeable fluff, but at least they're existent. Featuring new interviews with several cast and crew members, such featurettes as "The Class of '95," which discusses the cast, and "Language Arts," which discusses the many phrases that this movie brought to our pop culture lexicon, allow us to delve, if only just slightly, into the making and the impact of this movie. Also, the trailers from the previous DVD release are included.

Children of the 90's definitely need to own this DVD. Clueless is still a major part of America's pop culture today, and really, who doesn't love watching a 90's teen comedy remake of a literary classic like Jane Austen's Emma
