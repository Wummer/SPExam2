Quite a bit of what I see on the few TV channels I let my kids watch depicts either *borderline* behavior or is so vacuous I cannot stand it.  This series has a plot, good writing and good production values.  It has the added benefit that I can also stand to watch it.  I am hoping the second season maintains the quality of the first
