I love this video.  I get up before anyone else so that I can do this video and sometimes the meditation at the end runs a little long.  It's a fantastic meditation, though, that centers me for the entire day.  Ravi Singh has a wonderful and soothing voice that leads me through the entire video and makes everything clear.  Ana Brett does the poses very clearly, and even shows easier ways for beginners to do the more difficult poses.  I have already recommended this video to friends
