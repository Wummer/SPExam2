If you're a fan of vampires, werewolves, action, or gothic suspense, this is probably a movie you'd be interested in checking out. While it's not a groundbreaking film, it's a highly entertaining one, and one that, for me, is something I can rewatch several times per year.

The filming is very attractive. Everything is dark, yet not so dark you can't see what's going on. The movie has a gothic look to it - from the sets, to the costumes, to the lighting. (Please don't mistake the meaning of gothic in terms of entertainment as the same thing as the gothic lifestyle.) The music, mostly heavy rock, fits in well with the movie. And the action sequences are expertly shot and exciting to watch. The movie uses several techniques made popular by "The Matrix", but who cares? It works perfectly within this movie.

The only downfall of the movie is the complete lack of humor...there's not a single joke in the entire thing! Everything is so serious and dark that unless you're in a pretty good mood the movie could really bring you down...that's how heavy it is.

As for the set. The added scenes provide more insight, and the special features are a treat, especially the 45-minute documentary "Fang vs. Fiction", which talks about vampires and werewolves. It was very intriguing.

If you're a fan of this movie and you own the DVD already, I would recommend selling it and buying this version, it's worth the money
