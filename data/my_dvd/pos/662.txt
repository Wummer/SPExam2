This show really is a love it or hate it kinda deal. From the first time it aired in the summer of 2005 on comedy central up until now i've been a huge fan of the series. I was so sad to hear it'd been cancelled but I wasn't surprised. It was one of the shows I loved and planned my night around when new episodes were going to air. Now that the DVDs are out I can relive these 13 fleeting moments in TV that are, to me, some of the funniest things I've ever seen. Apart from the hilarious, oddball performances from Michael Michael and David the series was packed with guest stars including Edward Norton, Paul Rudd, and a whole lot more. Really, anyone that is a fan of comedy ala Strangers with Candy will find this funny. It has a similar nonsensical insanity that leaves you laughing til it hurts. 

Favorite episodes include:
Campaign
Paper Route
Coffee Shop
Novel
Meeting Girls
and
Vegetables

The extras on the DVD are really top notch including commentary tracks for every episode, a lengthy and interesting "History of Stella" and much more. The commentaries are just about as funny as the episodes as the three creators continue to riff on each other, giving some insight into the creation process, while remaining pretty well aware their show met with sub-par ratings. They take it all in stride and aren't too proud to poke fun at themselves. I think if this show had been on comedy central around the time Strangers with Candy was on it would have been given atleast three seasons. It's a shame. Definitely worth getting, turning off your phone, and spending a whole night plowing through the whole season. "And when I say plow that's a pun!
