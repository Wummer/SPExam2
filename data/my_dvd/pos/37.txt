I've seen this movie on TV a few years ago, but it just wouldn't leave my mind, so I ordered the DVD.
It's one of those movies you won't forget, because everyone of us has some kind of 'coach', as Mitchell calls it.
Morrie is a great coach, and if you watch this movie, you will see why it is so heartbreaking. An old, wise man, a long lost friend, who teaches the last course in his life. At home. One student.
A must have seen
