I loved the first and second season and was looking forward to season 3.  WHERE IS IT?  I hope that it is released soon.  It seems unfair to release two seasons and hold back on the ending!  A little unfair to the consumer don't you think!  It is my understanding that 3 seasons is all there is.  Is that correct
