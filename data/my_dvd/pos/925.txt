What more can you ask for (Lou Monte doing LUNA LUNA LUNA, it's here). POPE is Vincent Patrick's best written work and his screenplay works with Rourke and Roberts doing each other justice in the lead roles.  The inside buzz is Michael Cimino sat in the directors chair, but evidence to the contrary is offered:  The film is less than 3 hours in length and significantly lacks metaphors.  Instead, POPE is a raucous and likeable tale of NYC bottom feeders whose only place in Trump Tower would be behind a broom.  Geraldine Page gives an Oscar nominated supporting turn one year before her Best Actress win for TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL.  She's more enjoyable here
