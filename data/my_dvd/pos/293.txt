I am sure that if you are looking at this then you are a fan of the trinity movies.  The Nobody character is based on Trinity but with much more refined.  Terence Hill's Nobody has a certain directness and is  a much fuller character.  Henry Fonda's career in spaghetti westerns often gets overlooked and that is a real shame.  If you compare this to his portrayal of Wyatt Earp then you can see that the love of the western never left him.  This is much more the Fonda that one loves rather than the villian in "Once upon a Time in The West" (itself a great film).  I love showing this to people that have never seen it. They usally like it and then I move on the the Trinity films
