What more could a true Parrotthead ask for than Jimmy Buffett live at Wrigley Field?

This two-disc DVD set captures the truly historic concert from Chicago. Jimmy and the band put on a great show. It makes you feel as though you were part of the show.

The bonus coverage is not to be miseed. The time lapse of setting up the stage is fun to watch. And the Star-Spangled Banner performance rivals Jimi Hendrix.

This is a must for any music lover, but the true Parrottheads will definitely need to add it to their collection
