Excellent series.  The court room scene is hilarious.  I am curious to know if anyone else has noted the subtle anti Americanism of this series (I refer to the portrayal of the American guest) as well as in Upstairs Downstairs?  In both series, as in other British TV dramas, Americans are portrayed as crude and materialistic.  What about the Henry James/Edith Wharton type aristocrats who toured England in the 19th century?  Mr. Hawksworth and others seem to have forgotten them. 

When will series 2 be released
