If you love John Waters then you're already right there with me.  I would classify this as a bit tame compared to his other offings and similar in style and irony to the movie Grease but is a more self-aware film.

I love rooting for the Drapes and the idea that the Squares can become Drapes, which, thematically, seems to be a Waterian theme - that we can all get along if we have sex with each other.  Which is probably true John.

Oh yeah, and Johnny Depp is young here and cool and I think you will enjoy seeing both Ricki Lake and Tracy Lords and Willem Dafoe as well (I know I did)
