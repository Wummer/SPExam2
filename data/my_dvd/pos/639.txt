This is easily one of the best films of the 80's. Kevin Bacon is a GOD in this movie. He plays a total renegade that swigs booze and dances like the devil. When the Footloose song comes on the radio, my co-worker Tom and i cant help but busting into dance. Its films like this that can make you feel good and drunk with happy feet!! Buy this dvd for your collection and you'll be bursting into dance before u know it!
