On hearing that Warner Bros was to issue a set of Busby berkeley films, I ensured my DVD player was rendered region-free and then I waited. It was a dream finally come true.  Having been entranced by Berkeley's films since childhood I could hardly wait for the box to arrive.  Oh joy! The quality of the DVDs is wonderful and the added extras are very generous indeed, if some of these extras are not to one's taste, then fair enough, but the vintage material is absolutely fascinating and cleaned up to match the quality of the main feature.  

It is a shame that the Al Jolson number was removed from the compilation disc because it was not intended to be racially offensive when it was produced, but today's political correctness lobby inevitably takes its toll.  That said, we are left with a plethora of magnificence from Busby Berkeley which gladdens the heart and which left me euphoric because the quality of the release exceeded my expectations.  Thank you Warner Bros for the TLC you have lavished on this set, and you, dear reader, if you have not experienced the work of this great director before, I urge you please, please consider buying it - I can guarantee you will not be disappointed. This was Hollywood's Golden Age, so now you have the chance to experience it, PLEASE don't miss out
