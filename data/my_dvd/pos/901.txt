Even though it tends to drag and the abuse gets a bit repetitive, this is by far the best adaptation of the famous British Navy story. Gable and Laughton are perfect for their respective roles and the period is brilliantly displayed.  I'm not a huge Gable fan.  This and Gone W/ the Wind are abt all I like him in
