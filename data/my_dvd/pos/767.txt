A friend of mine told me about this movie and I went to the local video store and rented it. CRAZY!!! I thought that the CGI and wire work was so smooth that it almost looked real. However, after watching the special features of him doing the stunts from the movie LIVE!! Jackie who??? Bruce what?? Jet whatchamacallit ???? He is the martial arts star for the new generation.  For those that see the decline of martial arts movies, this kid gives us  hope
