The seventh season was the season that got me hooked to south park. Specifically episode number 712-all about the mormons. That was the first episode that got me into the show, and I haven't stopped watching since.  The season list includes the following:
704-Cancelled 
702-Krazy kripples 
703-Toilet paper 
701-I`m a little bit country 
705-Fat butt and pancake head 
706-Lil`crime stopper 
707-Red man`s greed 
708-South park is guay! 
709-Christian rock hard 
710-Gray dawn 
711-Casa bonita 
712-All about the mormons? 
713-Butt out 
714-Raisins 
715-Its christmas in canada 

also favorites from this season include 701-I'm a little bit country, which has the kids working on a report to present at the Anti-War/Pro-war rallies. I just love cartman's flashback in time to 1776.   Also, episode 709-Christian hard rock, Cartman and his band Faith +1 make it big in christian music to try and score a platinum album before Kyle does, all over a $20 bet.  Finally, Episode 708-South Park is Guay...What can I say..Crab People...who the heck thinks of Crab People.  
In all, this is the season that continues to have me in stitches, and if you can only own one season of southpark, I believe this is the one. I myself have them all, but this is the season I believe stands above the rest.
