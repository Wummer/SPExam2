it breaks all the rules. 

Breeder hunks play femme gay men. There is no one with AIDS in the whole story. There are butch gay men in this movie. And no, none of the gay men has a best friend who is a single, white, straight female. Can you handle it? 

The movie is entertaining. The plot is sweet. The best part of the film is the style in which it is broken up.
