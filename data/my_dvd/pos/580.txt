When I saw this I though Aquot;why not, it doesn't look overly violentAquot;.  Boy am I glad I tried it.  While there are the usual fight scenes the overriding theme is a wonderful sense of humor.  As a night owl, I adore the morning scenes using different, highly original, method to awaken the heroine.  A real keeper and I just wish it was a long series
