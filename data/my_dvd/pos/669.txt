Dark atmospheric telling of the tale. Very decent! It is a simply told ancient tale. The scenery is gorgeous. There's a good atmosphere of the barbaric time. It's a good movie, a lot of twisted emotion right up to the end. 

The movie conjures up thoughts of Gerard Butler as Aragorn, and Ingvar Eggert Sigur\ufffdsson as Theodin in LOTR.
