The series was always delightful because it was fun, done with panache and done with a little tongue in cheek. Pierce Brosnan was great and Stephanie Zimbalist was a wonderful partner. Loved 'em both. Nice to be able to see it again because I enjoyed it so much and because there is nothing on TV like it today.
