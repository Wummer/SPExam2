Hal Hartley never fails to entertain, never fails to engage my mind and emotions on a parallel level.  Simple Men is no exception.  The seemingly simple plot - two brothers in search of their missing dad - provides so much room for character growth that I wish there were an entire series of films centered around them.  

With a hard-edged view of the world as: "There's no such thing as adventure. There's no such thing as romance. There's only trouble and desire" (actually from a Fritz Lang movie of the 1920's) there's plenty going on to both prove and disprove Hartley's ambivalent theories.

Simple Men also formally introduces us to the absolutely delicious Elena Lwensohn.  In one of the coolest and hottest scenes in all of cinema we get to watch her bizarre 50's beatnik-style dance to Sonic Youth's "Kool thing."  Then joined by the two lost soul brothers it turns into an unlikely production number.  

Many dismiss this film, and Hartley as unwatchable or trivial and miss the point.  What is amazing about Hartley is that he takes the seemingly trivial and elevates it to a level of art that, once seen, reflects our lives on every level from brilliance to the inane.  

Simple Men is pure cinematic delight.  

Hooray for Hartley
