It's really refreshing to watch series such as Bones. It's witty and suspenseful. Unlike Law and Order, this show has more...well everything. 
The characters are all very likeable. There are little romantic moments between the main characters that make the show more interesting. 

basically...just get season 1, you won't regret it
