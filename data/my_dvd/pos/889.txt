this 1988 gore film (i can't call it anything else since it's not a horror film in the classic sense) features an ensemble of Treat Williams {most notably from the Aquot;SubstituteAquot; series of movies} and comedian Joe Piscopo, known for his years on Saturday Night Live and stand-up comedy impersonating the likes of Frank Sinatra and David Letterman among others. The two play cops, Williams is Roger and Joe is his partner, Doug. the back of the VHS gives a detailed description of the film, plus two pictures of some of the scenes in the movie. Lindsay Frost plays the stereotypical Aquot;innocentAquot; woman caught up in everything that's going on around her...but the corpse of the situation deals with Roger getting shot and coming back to life. he must solve a case within so many hours or he'll turn into ashes...and as the hours progress, naturally we start to see his body fall apart literally. Darren McGavin plays the part of an evil doctor. Vincent Price plays in a scene or two, and he's revealed to be the mastermind behind the Resurrection Room at the Dante Lab {he plays a guy named Loudermilk who everyone thinks is dead}. the movie is gory and off-beat, and it succeeds in being a good parody of the Lethal Weapon 'buddy cop' films even though it probably wasn't intended to be the first time around but that's the way i view it and on that point the movie is great. i give it four stars because of the gore and my personal dislike for gory/slasher films...but those who like that kind of film will LOVE this one. it's not so hard-core gore and so stomach turning it can't be seen several times...like many of the Texas Chainsaw films are...but Aquot;Dead HeatAquot; IS gory compared to other action films of this era starring Charles Bronson, Clint Eastwood, or Mel Gibson. i give it 4 stars for the story, cast, and acting...minus 1 star for the gore factor
