Probably the best place to start for Bergman initiates. Three decent films (although I think "Through A Glass" is in a different class to the other two features). Moreover, they all form a useful overview of the progression of Bergman's art from circa 1960 to circa '62; from the religious torment of 1961's "Winter light", through the conjunction of interpersonal conflict and religious neurosis of "Through A Glass..." to the explicit focus on familial relationships of "The Silence", (the latter reminiscent of Bergman's mid-to-late 60's output). In short, although there is nothing to match the astounding "Persona" (1966), the films do give a great indication as to Bergman's filmmaking in particular and the whole boom in Euroean Art House cinema of the early 1960s in general. 

DVD: Excellent Criterion transfers. The documentary disc a Swedish film about the production of "Winter Light") is excellent as well, worth watching alone for Bergman's casual conversations on his religious torment: he speaks of spiritual angst in the tone most people speak of going to the shops for a loaf of bread
