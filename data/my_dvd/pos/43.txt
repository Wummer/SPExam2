This is, as most critics agreed, the best of the trilogy.  Abrams' crisp direction keeps this film moving at breakneck speed from start to finish, including a few twists along the way.  I was thoroughly entertained by this outstanding action film.

The only thing I DIDN'T like.... the short pause in the middle of the film, probably for a change between the dual layers.  VERY annoying!
