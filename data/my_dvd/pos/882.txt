I love this movie. I can't go an entire day without watching it. One time i was in the audience of leno. Whenever the camera panned over us, i waved a copy of this pleasure in front of it while yelling about how funny this riot is. Ahh, funny i remember the part where that one guy has to itch his balls. Just thinking about it makes me tingle with anticipation!!! Rent this movie or you will not see it. Buy it or forever hold your peace
