 I don't think so, be it in the jungle, a New York high rise or at sea. Hepburn A Tracy were great, no argument. But they were so modern A urbane, not rowdy A sexy, always fighting like Harlow A Gable. China Seas is a fine example of this chemistry.  Yeah, A its a pretty good story too. Gable is Capt. Gaskell, skipper of a passenger/merchant ship running from Hong Kong to Singapore. Harlow is the floozie, Dolly, he had a fling with on shore. The ship is carrying gold. There is a terrific typhoon, A a pirate raid in which the ship is seized for a while. They torture the Captain, but he doesn't reveal where the gold is. Dolly is mixed up in a conspiracy with a crewman, Wallace  Berry, against the Captain because she is mad at him. She of course changes her mind. The Captain is trying to ditch Dolly A thinks he's meant for Lady Sybil, played by Rosalind Russell, an old flame. But he A Dolly really are in love. Unfortunately the collaborations between Harlow A Gable was cut short at five movies with Harlow untimely A early death several years later.
