Royal Wedding has been a favorite in the Fred Astaire canon ever since it was released 54 years ago.  Astaire and Jane Powell turn in some of their best perfromances in this film, and Astaire's dance on the ceiling ("You're All the World to Me") is classic.  The score, by Burton Lane (of Finian's Rainbow fame) and Alan Jay Lerner (future lyricist of My Fair Lady) is unbeatable.  I need not comment further on the film's merits--it speaks for itself.

The film is now in the public domain and, unfortunately, nearly all VHS and DVD releases of such films are deplorable at best.  That is not so in this case.  The DVD I'm commenting on here is from Goodtimes DVD (edition 05-81171), and I must say that the transfer looks pretty darn good for a PD film.  The picture is clear, for the most part, and although there are some minor color shifts and age-related artifacts present, they do not distract.  Colors are fairly bold and are well defined.  The soundtrack is pretty clear and sounds fine.  There are no extras.  I have a very old 1980s copy of the VHS tape from MGM/UA Home Video and also a VHS dub I did off Turner Classic Movies two years ago, and honestly, this DVD looks better than both.  It is about as good as we can expect for a PD film that has not been restored from original elements.  Goodtimes is often better than most in their releases of PD films--it could be a lot worse.  Warner Home Video, which controls video/DVD release rights to the rest of the old MGM library, has not given us a studio DVD release of ROYAL WEDDING as yet, and as far as I know none is in the works.

If you want ROYAL WEDDING on DVD, I absolutely recommend this Goodtimes DVD release--it is probably the best one you'll find, is at a very good price, and comes in very nice packaging.

RECOMMENDED
