Monty Python are probably the best known sketch comedian ever. They made a tv show, Monty Python's Flying Circus, and several hilarious movies.

AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
Their first movie, which is a collection of their best skits from their tv show. This movie is hilarious. It includes The Lumberjack Song, The Dead Parrot Sketch, The Dirty Fork, and the World Funniest Joke.

MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL
Their best movie. It's about Arthur and his knights looking for the Holy Grail. This movie will make you laugh insanely. Funny moments include The Killer Rabbit, The Knights Who Say Ni, and The Black Knight.

THE ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN
This movie is not a Monty Python film but was made by Terry Gilliam and co-stars Eric Idle, both of whom are former Pythons.
A must have for any Monty Python fan.

This set deserves the five stars and more. I recommend this to any Monty Python fan, British Comedy fan, or comedy fan in general. Too bad it didn't inlude The Meaning Of Life or Life Of Brian
