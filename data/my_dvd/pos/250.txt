This is worth buying just to see:

1.  The look on Pete Townsend's face when Billy Idol (as Cousin Kevin) puts his arm around Pete's shoulder.

2.  Steve Winwood realizing he doesn't actually know the words to the "listening to you, I get the music..." section of the last song.

3.  Roger Daltrey fumbling with a microphone that he'd tossed in the air and unsuccessfully attempted to twirl and catch.

4.  Some of the most hilarious haircuts and outfits in the history of rock and roll.

5.  The only halfway decent thing Phil Collins (as Uncle Ernie) ever did in his entire career.

This 3 DVD package also includes Quadrophenia and the second set from the night that Tommy was recorded.  This second set is full of hits and it's definitely worth watching.  (You could purchase Tommy and Quadrophenia individually, but you'd miss out on this hits disc.)
