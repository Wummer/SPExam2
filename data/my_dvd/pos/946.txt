Its hard to imagine that a war film can leave you with a big smile at the conclusion but here is one that will!
With non stop action, drama and comedy, Kellys Heroes has it all with a top notch cast and soundtrack to boot.
The original script of a bank heist behind enemy lines during WW2 is a classic and is brilliantly executed at all levels.
Even though the film is based on a fictional plot, it still has an authentic feel and is rated an all time classic.
highly recommended
