Many shows have their moments, but this is the first show I've ever laughed OUT LOUD, multiple times in one episode.  The humor is so creative and edgy and amazingly timed.  I will say that you do need to be around my age (I'm 40) to get alot of the inside jokes, but if you do their hilarious.  And if you don't there's still plenty to make you laugh.  I would HIGHLY recommend all three Volumes that are out now
