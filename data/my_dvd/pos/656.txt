This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film

"Harakiri" known in Japan as "Seppuku" is the story of a samurai who has lost his job with his clan having broken up. He then asks a feudal lord permission to commit hara-kiri on his property. 

That is all I want to say about the plot but it does get interesting.

The double disc set has some nice bonus features too.

Disc one contains the film with a theatrical trailer and an intruduction by Donald Richie. Disc two has a poster gallery and interviews with director Masaki Kobayashi, actor Tatsuya Nakadai, and writer Shinobu Hashimoto.

Fans of classic Japanese films will not want to miss this
