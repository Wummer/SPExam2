Having seen Stella's live show in Hollywood, I had a sneaking suspicion that I was going to love their Comedy Central show, and I was not disappointed.  These guys have mastered the art of genius-disguised-as-idiocy, and nearly every episode is hilarious from beginning to end.  I guess I'm not surprised it didn't last; this kind of humor isn't for everyone.  But come on...we are talking about a network whose supposed hits include Mind of Mencia and Blue Collar Comedy, both of which are among the worst dregs that the comedy world has to offer.  These guys have been making great comedy for a lot of years, and I hope to see them in another show or movie soon.  Until then, I'll be enjoying Stella on DVD
