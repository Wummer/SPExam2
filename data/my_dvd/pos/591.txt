If you have never been introduced to Thora Birch-this is the one to see.  I don't know if this was her first movie or not but she is really young in this film. If there were ever a star born "this is it". She is just unbelievable.  Griffin and Johnson are really great too.  This movie is actually worth watching for the scene location alone
