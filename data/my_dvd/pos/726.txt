The answer is No Deal!

In Ruthless People Danny DeVito is great as Sam and Bette Midler as  Barbara is terrific but
together they are a miserable couple. Sam, who has a girlfriend, Carol, wants out of the marriage but,
doesn't want it to cost him anything. When he learns that Barbara has been kidnapped, he thinks he has it made!
By not agreeing to pay the ransom amount, no matter how little that might be, he counts on the kidnappers
to save him from paying alimony by bumping Barbara off! 
The bumbling kidnappers are Ken and Sandy, adeptly played by Judge Reinhold and Helen Slater.
They have a grudge against Sam who stole their dress design and made a mint.
They are astounded when, after giving Sam their demands, he emphatically says, 'No Deal' and hangs up on them.
In desperation they lower the amount. Sam still says, 'No Deal'! 
Barbara learns Sam has refused to pay the ransom not once but twice!
She is furious and can't believe that she has been marked down like clothes on a sale rack!

Barbara and Sandy create a bond when Barbara, through a better diet and exercise, has lost weight
and needs different size clothes and Sandy provides her with clothing she has designed.
Barbara loves the designs and they decide to form a partnership.
Their first agenda being Sam and the second developing a clothing line.
The plot thickens when the police become involved, thanks to Carol. As suspicion focuses on Sam,
he is forced to come up with the ransom to clear himself!

Fuming, he gets the money and drops it off counting on the police to arrest the kidnappers
and retrieve his money. The drop off does not go well. A car chase ensues!
And then what happens next is . . . hmmm  . . . let's just say Sam's fortune takes a dive
