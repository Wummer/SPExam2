Gilbert Gottfried is a genius.  THANK YOU for making a DVD that puts so many dirty jokes where they long--together!  Of course I knew a few, but I learned so many more!  Gilbert's delivery is priceless, and his impressions of comics like Bill Cosby and Jerry Seinfeld make some of the jokes even funnier.

If you're a fan of filthy humor, this DVD is a MUST HAVE!  My personal favorite is about the guy who doesn't know if his wife has VD or TB...

And at $13.99...it's a steal.  DO NOT MISS THIS ONE
