The Danny Boyle directed "Trainspotting" was a somber view with some comedic overtones into a group of Scottish heroin addicted losers.  While the film garnered accolades, I found it to be profoundly disturbing as the seemier side of addiction was vividly depicted.  Ewan McGregor playing Mark Renton and his crew which included "Full Monty" star Robert Carlyle, as violent psycho Begbie, swing back and forth between kicking the habit and falling back in love with allure of a scag high.

Congregating in a filthy, deplorable shooting gallery the gang is shown in graphic manner getting high.  As a group they're abhorent of authority and employment and motivated only by scoring their next fix.

McGregor attempts to kick the habit by locking himself into an apartment with needed supllies.  Remembering the constipation from a previous attempt he goes out to score suppositories.  In a humorous scene, cramps force him to use the filthiest toilet in Scotland into which he drops his precious suppositories.  He then dives into the disgusting toilet to retrieve them.

McGregor eventually does clean up complete with cold turkey induced horrific hallucinations, escaping to London and working as a realtor.  His buddies follow him there and reel him back into the life.

McGregor and Carlyle and two other buddies eventually have their dreams come true,........the big drug deal.  They manage to complete the deal for 16,000 pounds which McGregor decides to steal.  He intends to use the loot to start a straight and clean life anew.  Fat chance
