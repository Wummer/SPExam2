These are the best dvds out there for babies because they are full of live action animals, people, flowers, water, etc.  I got them for my daughter when she was about 3 months old - she loved them then and she still loves them at 6 months.  They are perfect for the car for long trips to visit grandparents, and for afternoons when I need a break to cook dinner.  She laughs at the kids on the video and loves the animals, too.  The best part of course is the Christian music!  These videos are top quality and my daughter loves them - she gets bored very quickly with Baby Einstein.
