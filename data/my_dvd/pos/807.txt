"Mighty Quinn" features a young sexy Denzel Washington (Xavier Quinn) as a smart detective who did a stint with the FBI and returns home as police chief on a Carribbean island. There's a shadowy plot involving $10,000 bills, a guerilla movement and guns, but the movie focuses more on Quinn's conflicts because his childhood friend is suspected of a grisly murder, and Quinn's own discomfort from having "made good" but ending up caught between two worlds, white and black. He's also caught between the islanders' desire to protect their own and white political pressure to drop the investigation. This film is full of sexy island women, colorful reggae music, and real world dilemmas of race and identity. No matter that we couldn't quite figure out if the plot hung together. A winner
