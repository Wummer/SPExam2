THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE is the epitome of how sublime the Film Noir genre can be.  The story of a seductive young woman who goads the handsome hired-hand into murdering her much older husband.  Based on the novel by James M. Cain and boasting the stylish performances of Lana Turner and John Garfield, this film was ensured of becoming an instant classic.  Over half a century later, we are still singing it's praises.

From Lana Turner's memorable entrance as Cora Smith (clad entirely in white and smouldering like a stack of burnt tyres), the audience is taken on a rollercoaster of thrills.  The drifter Frank Chambers (Garfield) is so completely infatuated that murder can be as easy as picking up a lipstick case.  Cecil Kellaway, Karl Malden and Hume Cronyn co-star.  The new DVD from Warners includes a fantastic documentary about John Garfield, plus still-galleries and trailers.
