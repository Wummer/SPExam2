Ok, I understand the male and female symbols used on the movie logo.
Those represent the male and female viewpoints of the main two characters.
They are the traditional "Mars" and "Venus" symbols representing masculinity and femininity.
 
I also understand the last symbol representing "infinity", a never-ending loop symbolizing an ideal marriage that will last forever. Or maybe the propagation of "eternal life" by the offspring of the parents carrying on their genes into eternity.
 
But what is to be made of the star and dagger symbol??? 

Are these symbols somehow representing a conflict of religious values?
(The Star of David representing Judaism and a cross representing Christianity)

I haven't seen the movie in years but I don't remember a conflict in religious beliefs being part of the plot.
