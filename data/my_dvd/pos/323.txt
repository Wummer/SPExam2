My wife and I saw "Love Actually" when it first came out and fell in love with the movie instantly. Yes, Richard Curtis uses every trick to pull at our heartstrings, but it works.  And the crescendos and the various climaxes of each story keeps pulling me in.

When the movie first appeared on HBO, I always seem to find it and couldn't stop watching until the end of the movie.  I bought the DVD and it's become a family tradition to watch it Christmas Eve (most years).  And it never gets old.

I am not a fan of Christmas movies.  I've never seen all of "Miracle on 34th Street" or "Its a Wonderful Life", but I'm looking forward to sitting on the sofa with my wife to watch "Love Actually" again
