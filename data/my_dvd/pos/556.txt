I haven't watched the first season - I just started watching the show so I'm a very brand new viewer - but I've seen two episodes of season 2 and this is really a good show.  Its subject matter is grim, yes, but there are light moments and the cast has nice chemistry, especially David Boreanaz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel) and Emily Deschanel.  The stories are interesting w/out being too scientific so anyone can follow along.  And I never realized how much information a person can get just by examining someone's bones (okay, maybe only in tv land).
