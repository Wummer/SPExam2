We recently purchased this DVD for our three year old son who is obsessed with John Deere tractors.  He watches it over and over again until we can't take it anymore.  The songs are catchy and you will find yourself humming along even if you don't mean to.  If you have a child who loves John Deere, then this is a perfect DVD for them.
