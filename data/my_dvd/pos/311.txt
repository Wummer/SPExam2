This wonderful TV special from the 70's is timeless and has great music by Harry Nihlssen (not sure of that spelling).  The lesson is all about tolerance with lots of side issues of great value.  I am thrilled to own this DVD.  It brought back all kinds of memories for me - both the story AND especially the music. It is a perfect addition to my collection of movies for my grandchildren
