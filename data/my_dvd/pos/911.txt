I first saw this film back in 1987 over at a high school friend's house and have loved Isabeau and Navarre ever since.  This movie has it all: comedy, drama, and one amazing love story.  Who's heart didn't break on that one scene when the doomed couple could catch a glimpse of each other at sunrise?  Navarre's devotion was utterly breathtaking.  A wonderful, wonderful film
