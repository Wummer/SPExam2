This movie may not be for everyone, but to me it's highly memorable.

POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT:

This isn't your ordinary "travel back in time to alter the futures of people you care about"-flick (Back to the Future--although, granted, it was better made and more entertaining).
Butterfly Effect is really about (in alphabetical order) acceptance, chance, charity, choice, grownup love, hope, identity, opportunity, regret, and sacrifice.

Some reviewers mentioned the quality of acting.  Here are my thoughts:
Kutcher to me always seemed an innocent, caring, small town fellow more than the fun guy most of us might know him as, and that's why I wasn't surprised to see him pull off this role.  
Amy Smart was good mostly, but glaringly off-key at times (granted she had to show more range the the other actors)
