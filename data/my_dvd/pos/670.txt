i loved this movie. for those who gave it one star i guess didnt see how well it was done. In the american version all it was..was Sarah Michelle Gellar's face. The Japanese version was much better (considering it was original and made more sense).
it has alot of characters in it but not so much that u will get lost in all of them since they usually die or just dont appear until later in the film.It has some twists which are good.The american leaves out soo sooo much. In the american one it was basically a dead girl killing random people. In the Japanese one it is touching because the whole time the ghost was reaching out for help.  anyway i recommend this to anyone who loves  Asian horror and likes a good plot and movie!! go see it!! and enjoy
