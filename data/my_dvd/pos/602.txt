"The Five People You Meet in Heaven" is a powerful book with many mixed emotions. This film was a constant mystery as I never knew what would happen next. The story is all about the people who affected Eddie the most in his life. The people he meets in Heaven are interesting and also somewhat shocking.  Some people he knew, and some he had never met. This was a great idea. 
Mitch Albom kept me wanting to read as I usually am not too interested in books. This truly is the greatest book I've ever read and therefore I would definitely recommend it to everyone.
