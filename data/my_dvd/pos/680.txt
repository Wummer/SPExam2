I enjoyed Ice Age, and this movie is good as well. Thankfully, all of the cast from the original Ice Age returned, and the comedy as well. And, besides the characters, the story is another original idea, and a great stand alone movie by itself, and thankfully not a rehasing of an old one.  The Ice Age is coming to an end, and Our gang rallies the inhabitants of the valley to go on a trek for Higher ground before their Valley gets flooded. Manny, along the way, begins to question his own mortality and the fact that He is "the last mammoth"...or is he. Well, that what everybody thinks, until they run across a family of opossums.  Don't see how Opossums and Mammoths tie together, just watch the movie. Queen Latifah was a good addition to the cast. Great film, one for the collection
