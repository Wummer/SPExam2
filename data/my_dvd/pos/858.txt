What do you get when you have rock the devil's son and Adam Sandler pLaying the devil's son?You get Little Nicky.This is the strangest movie Adam Sandler has possibly ever played in.

You have two of the devil's sons who want to be the devil themselves and you have Nicky the nice as can be son.The devil doesn't think any of his children are good enough to take his place yet until he tells them otherwise.Little Nicky could care less but his two brothers are outraged.Rioting and leaving hell.Making it impossible for souls to enter or leave.All except for Nicky.He must leave his do gooder life and head to Earth and save his father and all the humans in general.Having a left hell he now has only himself and a little dog companion (Beefy).

Nicky has to learn to live a humans life and capture his two twisted brothers in a mystical flask.Balancing those two and the fact that he can't "release the evil" Nicky finds himself dazed and confused.The movie had some really cool side characters like two rockers/satin enthusiasts.The music is awsome with some good old Ac/Dc and the comedy is actually funny.Many say the jokes are kinda lame in this film i couldn't find a reason to critique this movie otherwise.The extras are great featuring an in depth look at metal bands and rock in general.
A must rent
