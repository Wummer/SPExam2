Okay, how many of you liked cheerleaders in your school or anybody who tried out for pageants?  Unless you were one of the misery causing bee-otches, you didn't.  This movie not only effectively makes fun of the way girls treat each other in the pageant arena, but takes a good crackshot at the mothers (Kirstie Alley's character is a real gem!).  It also makes fun of the people in Minnesota.  I see lots of reviewers from that state whining about this film, but heard the term "midwest" used far more often.  We feel your pain, but I would have laughed had they picked my state (which is very close to MN).  They poke fun at hunters, Lutherans (yes, I'm one), and lutefisk for lunch in high school (I'm also of Norwegian decent).  

The most fun to be had is the way this movie spoofs how nasty women can be regardless of class warfare, and what lengths some of them will go to just to get their way.  Funny and dead-on like the nailhead beneath a hammer, this movie is a nasty and fun treat for everyone who has ever been treated badly by the so-called local uppercrust.  Enjoy 100 minutes of vengeance, and then go out into the world feeling better about the fact that you're definitely not alone!
