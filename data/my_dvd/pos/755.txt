My kids just love this movie; Barbie in the 12 Dancing Princesses.  It is a very clean movie.  It is not scary except for the mean Duchess; but she really isn't scary, just mean.  It teaches about honesty and family, and how they care about each other; which is really good for children to see.  Plus it was entertaining and a whole lot of fun to watch
