This is a fantastic Keith Urban video.  My favorites would undoubtedly be "Somebody Like You," and "Raining On Sunday." I wondered why Keith wasn't barefooted in the "Where the Blacktop Ends" video :) even so it's a great DVD worth adding to your collection! My only disappointment was that there wasn't a video of "You'll Think of Me.
