This is my first WATP video, but I started at the highest mile because I am an intermediate/advanced exerciser so I knew I needed something high intensity to get my heart rate going, but mostly I was looking for variety in my workout.  And I must say, I just love this video.  It is the only video I own that MAKES me want to do it.  I truly enjoy working out, but when I find a workout that makes it fun and mixes things up, I know I hit the jackpot.  This workout can be perfect for most exercisers, although beginners probably want to start with her starter videos and gradually work up to the Super Challenge.  Leslie is a good instructor, but as most have mentioned, she does talk quite a bit and has a very annoying laugh.  But its about the workout, not the sound of her voice, and in that, WATP Super Challenge accomplishes alot.  I hope to buy more of her videos in the future.
