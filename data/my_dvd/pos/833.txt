Mario, Luigi, and Toad are back to save Princess Toadstool and themselves out of the evil King Koopa's hands. There are all of the remaining episodes on this disc except for four. I understand that Shout faught Dic for the remaining four with no success. Go figure. Oh well. You atleast get to see the other episodes on all of these discs with no audio problems as mentioned for season one. There are also special features on all four DVD's to play around with. Want to look at the outline for how the idea for the set came about? Take a basement tour! See how the creators met Lou Albano, plus more! Everybody get ready to do the Mario and go back to your child hood and watch the good guys win and triaumph over the evil forces of King Bowser Koopa.
