This movie will bring up your racial prejudices in ways that most movies just elude to.  It demonstrates how connected we all are as people, and how seperated we are by only one thing - our viewpoints.  

The acting is superb, and you get one cameo appearance after another, which is a treat.  Of course, the soundtrack is terrific.  The ending is intense to witness, one situation after another coming to an unfortunate finish.
