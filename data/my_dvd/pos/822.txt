A lot of people like me who watches superhero movies want to watch a whole bunch of action with soo much CGI you cant even tell what's real or not. Anyways, I expected this movie to have the too much action I can handle. Guess I was wrong. Don't get me wrong, I like this movie, but I just hope Spidey 3 will have tons of action!!!!!!!! And Tons of CGI EFFECTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!With 3 NEW VILLAINS!!!!!! WHOO HOO!!!!!!!! SANDMAN, HOBGOBLIN, and VENOM!!!!!!!!! Anwyays, just don't make the movie about Peter Parker, but Spider-Man, THANK YOU Stan Lee for creating Spider-man
