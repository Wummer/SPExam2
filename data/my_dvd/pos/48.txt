I'd give 4 stars for this DVD release.  The movie itself has a special place for anyone who grew up watching soviet movies.  To relate the atmosphere of an old 60's soviet "eastern" is not easy to an american viewer, and I believe a better english dubbing could do this movie a better justice.  Besides that, it's a must have, particularly for any russian ex-pat
