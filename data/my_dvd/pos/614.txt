I didn't watch this one before
Because of all the hype
Too many buddy comedies
Were coming through the pipe

This one caught me by surprise
It really was first rate
Two dudes who're crashing weddings
So they'll always have a date

Fast-talking party animals
With very rigid rules
Break it off before sunrise
Commitment's just for fools

Until one day one falls in love
The other falls in lust
If you want to see Vince Vaughn get hurt
Then this one is a must

Sometimes sappy, sometimes sweet
and often lewd and loud
but it doesn't stoop to flatulence
so it stands out from the crowd
