I really like this video because of its time (30 minutes regular with 10 min bonus segment = 40 min total) and I like the instructor.  Janice is really good, calm, cues well, doesnt talk a lot, and is not overly inspiring.  She clearly points out the person who will be doing alternative/low impact moves and then continues on.  There is nothing complicated about the moves and they are very easy to learn - no hard choreography either.  I use this w/ a compliment of other videos and it continues to be one I enjoy to return to.

There are 3 segments each focusing on a different section: core, upper and lower body.  The bonus segment is a high impact/faster segment combining all elements.  

Worth the time
