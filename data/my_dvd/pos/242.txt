For those seeking a captivating 99 minute escape from reality into a beautifully filmed, flawlessly written, directed A acted world of fantasy this is the must see movie for you. The character's Ryan (Ryan Kelly), Melanie (Hayden Panettiere), and Grandpa (Armin Mueller-Stahl) will collectively take you on a memorable journey you'll want to take over and over.
The "special feature" music video (Someone Like You)of Hayden is worth the purchase price in itself.
Pop a bag of popcorn, and invite the whole family over for this one,..they will be thanking you afterward.
