Naysayers have proclaimed this neglected gem as depressing and self-indulgent, but perhaps they are just scared of seeing a movie starlet get truly "real" and show us the ugly truths about celebrity.  Asia's film would make a good double bill with DOGVILLE to make audiences realize the commonality between star worship and cannibalism. Ms. Argento pulls no punches--she splatters herself all over each frame, even introducing the film in a video prelude. She should be recognized as a hero, instead a lot of critics and viewers may think she is just being a self-pitying exhibitionist. But I bet if a man made this film, these selfsame critics would line up to praise it. Obviously many self-proclaimed feminists (of both sexes) are still secretly terrified, turned-off and intimidated when a women dares to actually show her "real" self. They are all the more angry because their knee-jerk reactions remind them they are not as ready to hear the truly "liberated" female voice as they might like to think. I say Asia has created something truly new with Scarlet Diva. It's ahead of its time and will one day be recognized as the forerunner of a brave new kind of "chick flick.
