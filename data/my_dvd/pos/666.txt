As I understand it, "Police Squad" was one of the most requested titles for release on DVD.  It's taken a while for it to happen, but it finally has!  It's great to be able to replace my VHS tape that I recorded the shows on almost 20 years ago during a "Police Squad" marathon.  Having now watched the DVD, I now know that for almost 20 years, I've been watching heavily edited versions of the show.  But not anymore!  

Other reviewers have described the episodes, so I won't waste time doing that.  Suffice it to say, the show was ahead of its time as it really didn't become popular until it was made into the first Naked Gun movie 6 years later (and had two subsequent hit sequels).  But I was one of the few who knew in 1982 that it was a clsassic.  I always wondered why the show never worked on TV, but Leslie Nielsen probably explains it best in his interview that is included on the DVD.  He says that you actually had to pay attention and most TV is meant to be watched almost passively while doing something else.  And I think he's right.

So it's great to have these shows.  The extras are just so-so as the interview with Nielsen is too short and I don't think the commentaries give much to the episodes (especially the one commented on by Robert Wuhl of "Arliss" fame, who was a writer for the show).  Wuhl must say a dozen times "I don't remember this."  Might have helped, Bob, if you took 25 minutes to watch it before watching it for the commentary.  But I won't trim the rating.  It's the shows I wanted and have now received
