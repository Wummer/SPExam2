After buying the original "The Fast and The Furious" I found most of my enjoyment came from making fun of the movie and shaming it.  However, I can now say I am a fan of the trilogy (all 3 films are good).

Lucas Black is simply The Man and gives another great performance here.  Bow Wow does a surprisingly good job as well.  Car buffs and street racers will especially like this movie (which I am neither).  This is a fast paced and exciting action packed movie that many will enjoy
