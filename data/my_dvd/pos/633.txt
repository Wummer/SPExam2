SYBIL is a movie that was long overdue for an uncut release to the public. The performances by Sally Field and Joanne Woodward are impeccable and gave the subject matter (child abuse) and enormous amount of exposure at a time when it went largely unnoticed. Wharever disputes may have arisen since over techniques, both the book and the movie became musts for students of Abnormal Psychology at that time and for decades afterwards.
Joanne Woodward reverses her roles from "The Three Faces Of Eve" to portray Dr. Cornelia Wilbur with consummate skill, while Sally Field's performance as Sybil is awesome and breathtaking as she dissolves from one self into another (the movie works with thirteen of the Book's sixteen personalities).  Without being overtly graphic, the movie conveys all of the horrors of Sybil's childhood with an incredible impact.
The rest of the cast is excellent, with Martine Bartlett's "Hattie", Sybil's mother, in the chilling forefront and Natasha Ryan as Little Sybil close behind.
The real Sybil, unaware that Sally Field had just been chosen to play her based on her trial reading with Joanne Woodward, let it be known that she wanted Stewart Stern and Daniel Petrie to try and get Sally for her part. {From the Extras Bonus Disk)
I can't recommend the movie and the book enough to students of Human Behavior and Psychology, whether for personal of professional interests.
It took Hollywood 30 years to try remaking the film, which should indicate how high the bar was set by this original cast and production
