This dvd shows Shania's potential as a serious musician. With Alison Krauss and Union Station as her back up here, she is simply riveting. Too bad she is more interested in making a quick buck these days marketing herself as a pop star and making purely pop albums like "Up!" instead of making enduring popular country classics like "The Woman In Me" and "Come On Over". Maybe she's living too well nowadays to make soulful music. Get this dvd if you want to hear Shania doing something good.

4 Stars is for the short length of this dvd. We need at least 2 hours of this awesome music. Not the 50 minutes which is on this dvd. That's only enough time to drink 5 beers
