I almost gave up on this one forty minutes in.  Don't you do that.  The ending is superb.

Premise: working class girl gets dumped by her boyfriend and seeks work by housekeeping.

Well, that can lead to something better if you keep house for the right person.

Jacques (Jean-Pierre Bacri) who recently got walked out on by his wife, and who, not so incidentally looks sixty--well, fifty-five--(actually he was barely fifty when this was made, but you get the point) gets his ad for a housekeeper answered by Laura (Emilie Dequenne) who is twentysomething--a young twentysomething.

I guess there is not much else to say, and to be honest I decided I would force myself to watch the inevitable.  But the director is Claude Berri who directed two of the best movies I ever saw: Manon of the Spring (1986) and Jean De Florette (1986).

And so I stayed with it.  At about the fifty minute mark the movie started to get interesting.  I could feel that old guy/young girl love affair was going to take an unexpected fork in the road.  (As Yogi said, if you come to a fork in the road, take it.  The players have no choice.)  Obviously, old guy/young girl can end only one way: young girl leaves old guy for young guy.  This is biology.  It will be painful.

Claude Berri knows all this, and probably a lot better than I do.  And so guess what?

Well, I won't tell.  But you will find that the last thirty-some minutes of this sexy romantic comedy delightful, and especially the very, very clever and most satisfying ending.

Just prior to that Laura asks Jacques for his blessing.  He won't give it, but she is right: he should.  And then when we get the final "life is so...lifelike" grimace on Jacques's face, we can only smile.

Emilie Dequenne is delightful as the strangely wise and very natural Laura, and Jean-Pierre Bacri is winning as the old guy who knows better, but on reflection should thank his lucky stars
