I bought this only because i loved the first one, hoping it wasn't as terrible as the second. After i watched it i was so impressed. First of all i loved that it really didn't have anything to do with the first, aside from Cassidy being Katherine's cousin,and sharing the same last name (there is only one reference to Katherine and Sebastian in the beginning). It is much better than having different actors playing old characters, which drags a movie down alot. I thought the story was great,  with good twists.The whole cast is very attractive, which can't hurt either. The "bad" characters are all pretty likeable, aside from one, and all is well in the end. The best thing about this movie is the character Cassidy. I sarted out hating her, and ended up really liking her for her realness, and honesty she does not try to hide that she is a b*tch.  This actress does a particularly good job, pulling off both loveable, and complete brat at the same time.  I would definetly reccomend this movie.
