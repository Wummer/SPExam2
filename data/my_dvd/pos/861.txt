Read between the lines, Stephane is nuts about her, and totally paralyzed.  This reminds me of Remains of the Day. Everything is inside, screaming to get out.  But there we are, tension city, with  nothing to do but yell at the screen, "Do something!!! Kiss her!! .."  THe emotional tension is as tight as the violin strings in the background!   Vive la repressione!
