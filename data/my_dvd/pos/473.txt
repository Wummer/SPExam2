Three Stooges meet Aquot;Waiting for Godot.Aquot;  Lurie, Waits and Benigni turn in great performances.  They've been locked up in a Lousiana penitentiary for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Jarmusch gives you each of their sordid lives in turn before throwing them together in a jail cell.  Benigni plays wonderfully off Lurie and Waits, culminating in a hilarious version of Aquot;I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice scream.Aquot;  Eventually, they find the light at the end of a tunnel, only to have to escape through a swamp.  Jarmusch gives his characters plenty of room, making for many amusing interchanges.  Jarmusch provides deft camera work and his usual wonderful eye for detail to make this his most memorable film
