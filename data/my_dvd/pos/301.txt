This is a wonderful story showing the Universe can have Aliens that are not horrors monsters or disasters for humans and humanity.  Kids or Adults can see a picture of Aliens, not the usual us in a strange colored costume but folks we cannot see or even recognize as folks.  Strangers with a problem seek help and after receiving help, return the favor.
Aliens that flash thru the night abducting people, and destroying property are enemies.  
Aliens that come in the night, make contact with local people, seeking understanding and trade, are far more likely representatives of extra solar beings
