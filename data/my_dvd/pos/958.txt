If no adjective appropriately suit this vivid collection of avant-garde films from the 20s and 30s, one reviewer came close in his chosen nomenclature: this one-of-a-kind-combilation, indeed, is "indespensable"!

For anyone interested in or in some way connected to film and film studies this box set is a true gem as well as an overwhelming visceral experience. One dare even call it "edenic". 

Packed with cinematic treats - ranging from early classics as Joris Ivens' "Regen", through film historical curiosities as Marcel Duchamps' "Cinema An\ufffdmic" and Richter's "Rhytmus 21" to absolute rarities such as Kirsanoff's "M\ufffdnilmontant" - this impressive collection of short experimental films guides you through all main avant-garde genres of the 1920s and 1930s. From impressionist masterpieces ("M\ufffdnilmontant", "La glace a trois faces" [Epstein]), through dadaist art-films (Duchamps), French and German cin\ufffdma pur/Absolut Film ("Symphonie Diagonale" [Eggeling], "Rhytmus 21" [Richter]), futuristic statements ("Ball\ufffdt mecanique" [Leger]), dazzling city symphonies ("Regen") to such seminal early sound experiments as "Romance Sentimentale" (Eisenstein A Alexandrov) and "Le tempestaire" (Epstein).   

While some films may, indeed, only be labled "curiosities" others are sheer strokes of genius - my personal favorites being Kirsanoff's rare impressionistic gem "M\ufffdnilmontant" (with its impressive - in every sense of the word - use of constant P.O.V.-shots, concealing the first person) and Jean Epsteins masterpiece "Le tempestaire" whose use of suspense-generating musique concr\ufffdte (or "Slow-Motion Sound", as it were) and vividly, picturesque imagery make for a unique cinematic experience. - As visceral as it is beautiful to behold.

If only for its lack of a few early classics (notably, Ren\ufffd Clair's "Entr'act" [1924] and Luis Bu\ufffduel's "Un chien andalou" [1929] and "L'\ufffdge d'or" [1930]) this combilation of early experimental films may not be labeled "perfect". 

However, I am still to experience any other collection of its kind. For anyone studying film (whether by themselves or in University,) this box set may, indeed, only be ascribed the adjective "indespensible", as done also by a previous reviewer.
