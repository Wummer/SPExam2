This DVD was more challenging than I thought, but within a few short weeks I can already see an improvement in my flexibility and overall fitness.  Recently someone who had not seen me in a while commented that my body looked different, so I guess that means the programs really work. HAHA :-) Overall I have been impressed with not only the level of difficulty but also the variety of content and workouts available.  I easily recommend this DVD
