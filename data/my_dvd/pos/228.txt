I am not sure why the first person would direct people to read J. Michael Bailey's work... or why the second person would say that it is as if J. Michael Bailey wrote this himself...one he couldn't have because it is a documentary, and two his view points are way off compared to the one given by the documentary.  Considering his book is very demeaning of the trans community. And he was forced to resign from Northwestern University as the department head, because of his illegal uses of his patient's information in his book. 

"They seem like different species, because they are."
       I am not sure if I would say that the kids in this documentary are another species... or even that I am another species. They are humans as well and to reduce them to another species is simply rediculous. 

   I am not sure why everyone is referencing him, because his view on Transgender people is extremely negative.

... but to the documentary. I think that it gives a great overall view of the trans community, showing that we can stem from all different backrounds, and we can act in all different ways. Just as there are many different "normal" gendered people, there are many different trans people as well.  I believe that  ScubaOtter "seaotter7"  has the best overview of it.
