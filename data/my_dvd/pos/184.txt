This series is awesome, and I am incredibly happy to have it to watch over and over.  It speaks to the depths of the soul of a man.  Having experienced intense pain, though not in war, I find the emotion and the comeradery very intensely satisfying in this series.  This bonding is what men were meant to do, not just in war, but in our every day battles.  The sense of brotherhood among people with only one major event in common is instructional.  I recommend this for any group of buddies, or even church groups
