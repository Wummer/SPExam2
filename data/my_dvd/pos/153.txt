I'll make this short and sweet.  I used to work in spin.  I did advance, which is creating media events for politicians.  In other words, for a time I was one of those people that manipulated public thought by the way in which we delivered information.

I'll let others speak to the eerie connections to Orwell's foresight.  I'll let others write about how effectively the film makers make the case.

That which is represented in this piece is true.  The observations are astute.  The prognosis is grim.

I wholeheartedly recommend this film to anyone who clings to the belief in the ideas of the founding fathers.  Buy it.  Watch it.  Watch it again.  Share it with friends.
