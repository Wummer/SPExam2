I have a little brother who is 7, and severely disabled,(He's on a 9 month old level) Not much catches his eye, but one day when he was throwing a tantrum, I put it on nick jr,and noticed he stopped crying when he heard the sound of the  singing   Backyardigans. He couldn't stop looking at the colorful animation.This show is a lifesaver! It kept him entertained for the whole 30min. I'd heard about the show from a friend,who has a 1 yr old who loves the show, and she told me to try it out. I took her advice and my brother loved it! And as soon as I saw it on VHS, I bought it.He loves "the snow fort", but his favorite is "the Yeti", He laughs the whole time the penguin sings "The Yeti Stomp". I also  bought him "It great to be a ghost" DVD  for christmas.I recommend this for any little children, it works like a charm.[^_^
