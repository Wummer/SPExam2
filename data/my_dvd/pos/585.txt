I love this movie.  How can you not with such hilarious diologue?  One of my most favorites is when Yzma outlines her first plan to get rid of Kuzko.  Ending with a hilarious "I'll smash it with a hammer!"  But diologue aside, there's so much more to this movie.  The characters are so wonderfully individual, from self-absorbed Kuzko, to evil Yzma with her "secret lab", to dim witted Kronk with his shoulder angel and devil
(Secondly, look what I can do.
Um, I don't see how that...
No, no.  He's got a point.)
Over and over agian, this movie will keep you laughing.  Watch, and enjoy
