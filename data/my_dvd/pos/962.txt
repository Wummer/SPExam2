I have been using Callanetics off and on since the 80s. I was so excited to see that it came out in DVD format and wasn't discouraged to read that it didn't have chaptering - Callan always has recommended doing the full workout anyway. But, I was pleasantly surprised to see that this DVD now has chaptering. So, please don't let that discourage you from trying this awesome exercise program! You will see truly amazing results in a short amount of time. I have used it only 3x so far this go around and I already feel stronger and have better posture. Have fun
