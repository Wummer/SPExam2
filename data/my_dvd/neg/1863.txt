QD3 has put out some good product before but thid dvd is kind of weak. The Roxanne battles, EPMD, KRSANelly, CanibusALL, And Ice Cube vs Cyprus Hill was dope but the DVD feels incomplete. The Grandmaster Caz vs. The SugarHill Gang beef that can be found in the extras should have been in the main movie. I would love to hear Big Ban Hank try to refute what Caz says. The Royce/D12 beef was obviously a replacement for the eminem/source beef and word is the source punked them out of using the footage.
Buy this used or at a discount but it's not worth the full pric
