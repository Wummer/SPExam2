The premise - that one could change specific events in ones' past through psychic concentration - could have been the foundation for a fascinating thriller.  I don't condemn the film's corollary either: that each change produces new, unforseeable tragedies.  It's the way the story is told - its ham-fisted dialogue and plot, its forced obscenity at every turn - that reveals its teen sensibilities.
     It is therefore fitting that the director's preferred ending is included here.  It is the perfect catharsis for teens who "...wish I was never born!
