WARNING: SPOILERS. Opening scene is quite shocking.  Some graphic effects.  There is more male nudity and male genitalia than female.  There is only one quick...very quick female genitalia shot near the beginning, or "end" of the movie.  Since the movie begins with the "ending scene" and ends with the "opening scene".  The rape scene is violent, with graphic language.  Obviously actual penetration is achieved (anal)...but none shown.  Not even a good boob shot.  You "of course" see the male genitalia (big deal)!

Movie is revenge driven...and that seems to be about it.  Doesn't have a great script...may be good to the French...but, not to US standards.  Movie is in French with English subtitles.
