Robert Groden suggests that the Zapruder film of the Kennedy Assassination has been tampered with to cover up the real killers of Kennedy.  In my opinion, his "evidence" is shaky at best.  Groden has made a lucrative living off of proposing alternative theories of who "really" shot Kennedy, and here he is in 2003 suggesting that there was a conspiracy to kill Kennedy despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary presented by ABC, CBS, and many books.  Groden needs to finally realize that the Kennedy assassination has been solved definitively, and his continuation of conspiracy theories is clearly his lame and pathetic attempt to keep his money cash-cow alive.  

Don't draw a conclusion based on this DVD!  Look at other sources listed below and then draw your conclusion:

1.  ABC's Peter Jennings presentation of the Kennedy Assassination (available on Amazon.com) clearly shows that Oswald was the one and only killer of JFK.
2.  CBS's Dan Rather's special program on the Kennedy Assassination (available on CBS website) also suggests that the preponderence of the evidence points to Oswald as the lone killer.  
3.  The book "Case Closed", by Gerald Posner.  He uses the physical evidence collected in Dallas, logic, and his ability to see through the fallicies of the conspiracies to show that Lee Oswald is the lone assassin.  
4.  The book "Marina and Lee", by Priscilla Johnson McMillian.  This book shows that Oswald was certainly capable of the assassination, and the circumstances of his life point to the conclusion that he killed Kennedy.  

My advice is to watch this DVD first, and then look at the sources I list above, and then make an intelligent conclusion.  If you are like me, you will see that Groden really has nothing solid to stand on.
