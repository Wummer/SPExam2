Why oh why do they keep placing redneck Tim Allen in Christmas movies? He can't act and he is disgusting. I am ashamed at Jamie Lee Curtis for reducing herself to this garbage. I can understand Tim Allen thinking this was a good script, the producer probably mailed the script to him as a coloring book  with pictures...but I had higher expectations from Jamie Lee Curtis. I have to say I usually love her. But she was awful in this film. She is reduced to whining and crying. She does little else besides agreeing to everything her caveman husband tells her.  Tim Allen was awful from day one in his redneck Middle America sitcom, and to this day retains that disgusting, overweight, burping middle America character.
Why do they keep putting him in Christmas films? It really does nauseate me to no ends to see him playing Santa Claus.
