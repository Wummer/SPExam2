The concept of this movie looked interesting but as the story unfolded "The Girl in the Cafe" turned out to be a left-wing political message.  I wonder if the writer of this movie realized the blatant hypocrisy in the character "Gina"?  Gina browbeats the members of the G8 conference over the terrible poverty and suffering in the world, particularly involving children while she initiates a sexual relationship with a man she barely knows.  Does the thought ever cross her mind (or the person writing the script?) that casual sex is one of the primary reasons for the rampant spread of HIV/AIDS, all varieties of venereal disease, children born out of wedlock, etc?  Maybe Gina should look at her own life before judging other so harshly.

This movie is unrated at the time of this writing but would likely receive an R rating for nudity and language
