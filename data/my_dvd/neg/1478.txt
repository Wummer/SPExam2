Surprisingly sleaze and Chauvinism
by female Director Heckerling! She
duplicated it in Chevy Chase vehicle
National Lampoon's European Vacation
too! Many child actors got their start
here, but the thing that cracked me up, 
as I saw it when it came out (unfortu-
nately) was the dialog of my fav band,
Cheap Trick: Ticket scalper "...The
magntism of Robin Zander and the 
charisma of Rick Nielsen...and what
about the tunes, 'I Want You To Want
Me, The Dream Police...nan-nan-nah,
'You're momma's alright, your daddy's
alright, they just seem a little weird,
Surrender, surrender...", before he's 
interrupted. If that isn't somebody's
idea of 'Surrender', they've stumbled 
onto this review by mistake
