This is the most tedious, unfunny, overrated movie of all time.  It's interesting that this is from the same man who produced Spaceballs, which was actually rather humorous (though also quite tedious at times).  I'll always be at a loss to understand why people think it's so funny.  His utter lack of subtlety is terrible to behold
