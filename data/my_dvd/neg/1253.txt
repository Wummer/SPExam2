Film: 4.5 stars; DVD: 0 stars
(DVD released March 2000)

This is a very good - albeit not great - film whose DVD release has been ruined by Disney, as they so often do:
- 18(!) minutes deleted from the theatrically released version
- non-anamorphic transfer
  
It's been over six years since the DVD was released.  One can only hope that an un-butchered version is in the works.  However, based on Disney's track record, and on the quality of their marketing "wizards", I'm not holding my breath.  Don't know if Disney licenses to Criterion but, if so, that may be the only way we get a decent DVD release
