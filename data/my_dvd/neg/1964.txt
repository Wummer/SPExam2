The only other FF material I've see is the movie and I didn't play any of the games yet so I'm not basing this review on that. After watching the first 3 dvdsand about 1/2 through the show i can say for me this show sucked. 
 The animation was bland and ugly looking. The C.G animation which was produced by GONZO was poor and didn't blend in at all.  (If you want good works by GONZO check out Full Metal Panic, Vandread, Hellsing, Gatekeepers and a few others).
 The plot was seemed to aimed at kids under 12. 2 kids and an adult woman get on a train in an abandoned train station that leads them to a different world. There they meet a strange man(strong silent type). Each episode goes something like this. The kids and woman get off the magic train at a strange place. The bad guy(kid??) sends his minions to where they 3 are. The man in black shows up(approx 7 min left in ep) and does nothing until the kids are in real danger then a light on his gun(attached to arm)turns on and he says "IT HAS MOVED??" yells "SOIL IS MY POWER" (cue in 2 minute transformation sequence where he puts 3 different colored shells in it and shoots ) a creature pops out of the smoke and defeats the bad guy, then he goes away. The kids and woman then get back on train and the show is over.
 That happens every single episode and there is very little plot development. Come on at least Pokemon has more of a plot.
 This show is clearly aimed for kids 10 and younger which from what I understand is not a big "Final Fantasy" demographic. 
 Strongly recommend a rental to see if you like it.
