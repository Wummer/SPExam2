Did anyone else watch the same movie that I did?  Or should I say try to watch the same movie that I did?  I am a huge classic sci-fi movie lover and had heard good things about this one.  I was mislead.  I can seriously think of no redeeming value to this movie.  In fact, I am sure that Carpenter and O'Bannon are quite ashamed of this black scar that lingers in their past.  The unwitty dialogue tries to be clever all throughout the movie and is just sooo boring.  The 'effects' don't exist, and the whole alien beach ball thing is just embarrasing.  It's not funny - it is embarassing.  I could make a better movie with a handycam in my garage
