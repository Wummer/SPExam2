Each scene is one shot, and that shot goes on and on and on, sometimes staying with the same act or lack of action.  This film is pretension personified, but that's okay.  Many people can't tell the difference between pretension and art.  The music too is full of squeaks and squawks.  In case you didn't know, that means that the music too is high art.  

There is no story.  Boy and girl see each other, and without preliminaries hit the sack.  We see boy A girl here, there, in the sack, here, there, in the sack, etc.  Occasionally we get a shot of some of the other characters.  

Because of the lack of dynamics, the film is not effective, either as drama or as eroticism.  Ironically, "The Summer of '42" was much more erotic even without any nudity (which would have helped).  

The vaulted sex scenes are three in number, chest and shoulders, and they last about three minutes each.  The much-touted fellatio scene is actually surprisingly good, more convincing than the "love" scenes.  

There are also a few brief full-frontal scenes of the star, who has a gorgeous body (hence, the two star rating).  

Bottom line: the only reason to see this movie is the nudity and the sex.  But there are many better movies for that.  So, only if you need the pretentiousness in order to permit yourself to see a sex movie should you see this.
