My wife and I ejected this DVD after half way through and planned to throw it out.  I later figured I'd see if it got any better and watched the rest of it.  The last guy is good and I won't throw this away now; he does a bit on throwing up that is good.  Most of the humor is gutter humour and is not that funny
