I bought this DVD based on the review of it on the DVD Drive in web site. Either the person who reviewed it has never seen an exploitation movie before, or was not old enough to view one in the first place. He made it sound like the most graphic and disturbing prison movie ever. You would have thought it compared to the 'Ilsa' movies the way this guy went on about it. I'm not sure what movie he saw, but it wasn't this one. When the most extreme scene in the movie involves a person being shot at falling over bloodlessly like an old western, you have to wonder why exactly it merited an "unrated" version.
I guess it's worth it if you want to see naked women dancing around in a circle, but it you want to see a gritty violent movie, buy something else
