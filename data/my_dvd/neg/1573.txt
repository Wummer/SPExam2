I've owned the LaserDisc version of "New Order Story" for 5 years and watch parts of it at least once a week, so I thought having the DVD version would be an upgrade.  Not at all, it's a cheap transfer from LaserDisc.  The DVD containing "A Collection" has defects in it.  I mainly bought it so I could have the full version of the promo for "The Perfect Kiss", -which in "story" is almost ruined by Bono's horrible voice- but it turns out it has a huge skip in the DVD version.  I didn't even care to test the rest of the disc and just returned it.
