I really enjoy both Nathan Lane A Matthew Brodderick. I'm a marginal fan of Will Ferrell (in this movie, I thought he was *way* over the top). And it seems, nothing in this movie/musical really gels.

I knew Nathan Lane sings really well, and was actually pleasantly surprised at Matthew Brodericks singing voice. Not pitchy at all - good voice. But the plot was lame A slow. The songs didn't flow well. And, I belived it was too much "stage" and not enough of a movie.

And, I didn't really find it that "dark" (even though that's how this movie was advertised). Mild satire maybe, but nothing near dark. It's more accurately described as bland!

Frankly, nothing in it worked for me. It was a big disappointment. If you're *really* into musicals, then you might like it just for the singing - that's the only reason I stuck with it for the first 45 minutes. Maybe my grandparents would like it... I don't know. I'm somewhat confused by the positive reviews here.

But I just had to shut it off - there was nothing advancing the plot or the characters, so I just didn't care how it ended.

1 star for the plot, 1.5 stars for the screenplay, 2 stars for the singing
