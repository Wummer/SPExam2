this has got to be one of the WORST, most unrealistic movies to date. i never have high expectations for lesbian flicks--rarely are they done well. this one, however, takes it to a whole new level. what was courtney love thinking?!

you'll regret wasting your money on this. i can't even fathom why it's gotten decent reviews so far
