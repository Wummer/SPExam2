This review is based on the differences between the standard DVD disc and the Superbit version only.  Based on that, I recommend that you save your money and get the standard version.  You'll get more features, while barely losing any audio or video quality, which is the whole reason for buying a Superbit disc in the first place.  I've watched this movie on my 40" LCD Sony XBR BRAVIA (720 dpi), an OPPO upscaling DVD player, and 5.1 sound system, and for this movie, I didn't see any perceivable difference in video quality from the standard version.  So unless they're selling this Superbit version for 10 bucks or less (which seems to be the trend since Superbit discs may become moot now that HD DVD and Blu-Ray discs are starting to come out), I'd recommend getting the standard version of this movie, which sells for about 10 bucks at the major electronic retailers
