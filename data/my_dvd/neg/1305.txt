I purchased this movie because I love Chris Cooper as an actor and because the reviews were very positive.  I played the movie yesterday and boy, was I disappointed.

The movie was much too slow and boring. I love mysteries and hate dramas therefore I thought the little personal stories throughout with flashbacks actually detracted from what I thought was going to be a good mystery story.  In the end the mystery is solved with a thud and don't get me started on the quasi Luke A Leia moment at the end.  PLEASE!
