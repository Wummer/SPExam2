Picasso is one of the giants in the history of Art and surely THE artistic genious of the 20th Century, but this renders him boring and repetitive. It was done while he was alive, and has him "painting" little cartoon-like "works" that were done only for this DVD...one...after...the....other ad nauseum.  This is Picasso as celebrity entertainer cartoonist, not the edgy artist genius of Les Demoiselles d'Avignon and Guernica.  It looks as if he's painting with magic markers on screen and the action is speeded up so it looks like a cartoonist at work.  I turned it off after 30+ interminable minutes.  Fortunately I rented it on Netflix, which I'd recommend, rather than buying it
