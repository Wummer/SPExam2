Great movie. The problem is in the medium of delivery.  There are 2 dvds in the package. Each dvd contains approximately 1/2 of the movie.  The audience/customer would be better served if the entire movie was on one dvd.

In addition, the 2nd dvd is defective.   The scene where Alexander's father is assasinated consists of some normal footage, many lengthy 'still' pictures, no picture at all for a period of time, and a short period that looked like satelite feed was breaking -- all on a dvd that's supposed to be flawless
