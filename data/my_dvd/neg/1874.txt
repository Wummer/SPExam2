If you own or have watched "The Blue Planet" series... you're going to recognize all of the footage.  Why?  Because you've already seen it.  Except this time it's going to be without the informative narrative.

For those of you who just want to watch a nature movie with very little talking... then I guess this is for you.

The only reason I'm giving this two stars is because the (reused) footage is incredible.  I don't particularly appreciate being misled by the advertising... I was expecting something new, not the recycled and repackaged presentation I got
