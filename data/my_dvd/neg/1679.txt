First off, I am a HUGE Pixar fan. In November in '95 I took my company to see Toy Story and within 6 months of that showing I got rid of most of the employees that didn't like the film. I've seen every Pixar film at least 5o times. Nuff said.

Anyway, I liked the film Cars.. but not as much as other Pixar flicks.. Its still good..

However, the DVD is underwhelming: a) no commentary b) horrible deleted scenes c) not much in extras. The Route 66 mini-documentary is ok though..

This DVD is about as bad as the first release of A Bug's Life.. another skimpy release on DVD..

Finally, they didn't include a tribute to Joe Ranft.. That's a huge crime in itself.
