There are two main reasons why this Superman film fails to fly inspite of the special effects.

What Singer and company have missed is the heart of Superman - virtues.  The ideal of the American way (noticably absent) is supposed to go hand in hand with truth and justice.  Donner made the mistake in the 70's of having Superman sleep with Lois, and now Singer adds insult to injury by having Superman discover he has an illegitmate child that he doesn't take responsibility for (deadbeat dad).  Using his super powers to invade the privacy of Lois in her home, drags Superman down to the level of creepy (peeping tom).

The second issue concerns personality.  Routh and Bosworth look nice but have no charm and no chemistry.  These are the two ingredients that made Reeves and Kidder so endearing.

A new director, writers, and cast is needed.  Until then, at least there's Superman 1.
