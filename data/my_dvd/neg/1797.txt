Ernest Borgnine would be spinning in his grave if he were dead.  There is absolutely nothing funny about this movie!  The actors should be embarrassed!  I could only stomach 25 minutes of viewing and it was about as funny as a viewing in a mortuary.  I can't believe I paid $9.99 for this DVD.  What a fool I was.  Learn from my mistake
