I have to say that I was not familiar with any Darkman comics, or had had any other contact with the character apart from this movie so I cannot compare the character to other sources. Therefore, coming from someone that did not "know" Darkman prior to the film I have to say that the movie was quite a disappointment!
There are the obvious comic book characteristics that one finds in these types of movies, like the Shadow, Batman etc, which is interesting.  
Nevertheless, Darkman was quite a disappointment considering the make-up of the cast: Liam Neeson, Larry Drake, and Frances McDormand among others.  It is the story of a scientist who falls victim to a group of gangsters resulting in his horrendous disfigurement.  In an effort to exact revenge, he makes use of his latest invention in order to appear like his targets/victims....  
In short, the acting and the plot are average (nothing great), while the dialogues are way below average.  The movie falls into the action/adventure/horror type of category.  
The characters are, overall, bland and just plain uninteresting (e.g. Rick Anderson played by the "fool," Ted Raimi, from the Xena series).
Though the potential for a good movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...  
In a nutshell, it's not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it might provide for an evening's entertainment, and that's about it. 
No masterpiece here... 2 Stars
