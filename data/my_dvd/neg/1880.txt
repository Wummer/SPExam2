I bought this DVD because Amy Jo Johnsen is in it. (One of my favorite actresses.) What I expected was a decent vampire movie, with some blood and guts, and a good storyline. What I got was a movie with TALKING, TALKING and more talking, and a boring storyline. I saw hardly any action, hardly any fun, and hardly anything interesting. I was extremely disappointed in Amy for starring in such a boring, unintriguing movie. The only actual action was toward the end with the final battle between Seth and Viki's ex. It was about an hour and fifteen minutes of explanations, and useless talking.
If you are looking for a movie with some action and fun, look elsewhere.
As much as I hate to put an Amy Jo movie down, I am doing so.
