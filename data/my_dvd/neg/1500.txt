So-so movie. It has it's good parts along with some boring parts but overall, good special effects with the ghosts. There were bloody parts in this movie making it more enjoyable to watch. When a very rich man dies and leaves his state of the art home to his nephew, he moves in with his family only to find out that there are things in the house that he was not aware of............. many ghosts. Just a OK movie.
