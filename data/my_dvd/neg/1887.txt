Ok, I am trying to redeem myself from low budget movies such as " Vampire Assassin" then I run into another bad movie. Lets face it, this movie totally blows. And what is with the main character and her cheesy fighting sound effects? What was Eva thinking when she decide to appear in this movie, she wasn't even the main star. More like a background character with maybe 3 sentences to say and thats it.
Please rent this one
