For months, Disney advertised this as a 2-Disc Special Edition DVD. But at the last minute, that second disc mysteriously disappeared. WHY? This is false advertising, and if I had my way, Disney would have a big fat lawsuit on their hands. It's unfair to force people who really want a 2-Disc to pay very expensive import prices to get one from the UK and to those of us who don't own a region-free player. They did this same crap to Alice In Wonderland, but the other way around. UK lost a disc that we have, and Paramount and Fox have done this to US fans of Titanic by dropping the 2-and-4-disc editions in the US, but not in the UK, and giving fans in the US a 3-Disc edition. I don't understand why these movie companies can't be consistent with their international releases and simply make a single version available for all people all over the world.

Unfortunately, I have chosen not to buy this crappy excuse for a "Special Edition" DVD. I do not appreciate being lied to. I still love Disney movies as well as the excellent DVD editions, when Disney actually releases the product they've advertised for months, and I will continue to buy the QUALITY DVD releases, but I do not enjoy false advertisement
