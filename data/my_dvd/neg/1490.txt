I purchased this movie as it was labeled an epic film and someone even compared it to the best love story since Gone with the Wind.  Give me a break!

This movie had an agenda 25 years ago, and it still comes across that way in 2006.

The rating of PG is a joke.  Please do not watch this movie with your kids!  It is certainly has a more mature theme than what you would think.

The plot is lame and I am sorry I spent the money on it.  I plan to get rid of the movie and exchange it as used somewhere where I can get something that is entertaining, this certainly was not.  I did not even reach the end of the first disc before turning it off.

For top names in the industry making this film, all I can say is they got paid a lot of money for nothing.
