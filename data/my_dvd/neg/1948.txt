Unfortunately they just do not get off the ground.  Python is known for being wired provocative and in many cases cutting edge. Regrettably they missed the mark on this one. One or two skits may strike your fancy but you have to wade through the rest to get to it. 

However if you like sex, violence, blood, and debauchery, could care less the fact that they have nothing to do with the absent plot, you could find this film interesting.
