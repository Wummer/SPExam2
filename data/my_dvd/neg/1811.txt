I am referring to the Laser Light dvd edition of this film, which promises the best digital transfer of the film.  That is great, but they used the worst print anyone could concieve to transfer!  I taped this off of television awhile back and decided to buy a dvd version and this is 100 times worse than the version I taped myself on the slowest speed off of late night tv!  In reading other reviews it appears that there is a much better VHS version and I would recommend that over this.  Do not be fooled like I was with the fine condition of Welles' Aquot;The TrialAquot; by Laser Light or the pipe smoking picture packaging of this.  This version of Arkardin is a total waste of money
