AND THAT IS BORING AND SNOBISH!  I watched the first two hours of this and coudn't keep awake.  The narritor's voice was monotone. I wanted to shout at his pompous, snobish demeanor SHUT UP!!  In my opinion is not the proper way to educate is to entertain at all god's peoples. With the narritor, granted he is educated but does he have to shove his creditals and his attitude from the gecko. When you take people on a educating journey (such as nine hours long) invite them like you would invite into a warm a loving welcoming home. I felt with his demeanor and atitude felt beat up and like I was crawling on my hands and knees through out the first two hours. I am not watching the rest of the seven hours and returning this DVD set back to the library and saying "Check Please".
