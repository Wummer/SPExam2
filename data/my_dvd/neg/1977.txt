How sad and pathetic this concert is.I loved the Dolls but this dvd is so bad it almost diminshes their legacy.After seeing how good the Stooges reunion concert was I was hoping for more of the same ...wrong!!It becomes painfully clear from the start that Johanssen in particular is phoning it in.Low point of the show is when they make "Human Being" [one of the greatest rock-n-roll songs ever] a sing-a-long.Give me a break!!!!
