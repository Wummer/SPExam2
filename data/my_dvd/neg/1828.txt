I hate to be the dissenting voice here, but The Boost is one of the most hilariously bad, cliched and over-the-top pictures I've seen in a long while.  It's so silly it unintentionally wanders into John Waters territory several times.  The thing is, James Woods acts like he's on coke before his character starts doing coke, so when he actually starts the coke binge, the movie enters a hyperreal realm of ridiculousness.  Still, it has its moments, such as Sean Young falling down a flight of stairs and having a miscarriage, or Woods explaining that cocaine "just takes your natural energy and amplifies it".  A good title would be "National Lampoon's Cautionary Cocaine Tale of the 1980s"
