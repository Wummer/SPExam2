The only reason why I saw this was because of Susannah York. This shows she was more capable of the dix she played in Aquot;The Killing of Sister GeorgeAquot; and was a fine actress. Otherwise this movie is blah. It's okay to make a surreal other world but you have to make it interesting. The men in this movie are so disgusting one can't blame her for getting mad anyway. For another pointless film of this caliber see Secret Ceremony
