If you have bothered to read all the other reviews here, i think you will get the point, but still unsure ?

Think of KNIGHTRIDER from the 70`s ( i`m sure EDI used the same voice !! ) then add some THUNDERBIRD puppets ( thats a bit mean, at least they had personality ) then add a dash of C.G.I. on a budget, oh and not forgetting that the whole script was written by a seven year old! 

A bit scathing you may feel - but deservedly so i`m afraid. 

Seriously, watch some paint dry for a couple of hours, at least the fumes will give you some sort of a buzz.
