Every minute characters in this series try to remind you of some plot point as if you're a short-attention span coach potatoe.  Ehhh, ah yes, you are.  Well, watch this and your life will pass by quicklier than already does.  Two or three nice ideas, the rest is very superficial and underutilized.  Probably there was an exec there that keeped destroying the good work of other people.  What I would do with a tenth of the budget of this misfire!
