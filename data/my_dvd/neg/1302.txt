When I saw the movie, it was so predictable. Halfway into it, the broadcasts were so lame as well as the so-called live-footage. Total rip-off of "War of the Worlds." Reminded me 
of an NBC-TV movie from the early 80's called, "Special Bulletin." Much better with it's live-broadcasts! The only 
thing i liked about this movie, when I switched back to catch it's climax ending. They never even saw their ever-ending doom.
Sure put's the military in it's place!
