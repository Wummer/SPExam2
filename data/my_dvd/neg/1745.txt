This experience was TOTALLY UNSATISFACTORY!!!  I received a notice that the product had been shipped;  it included a very long number to trace the shipment. It was promised for February 6th, but did not arrive. On February 16th you wrote me that the shipment was never made.  Now which is it?  Did you have it, and misplace it in the process, or did you lie when you said it was already send out?  I have had otherwise good results in  my purchases from amazon,  but this is a real mess-up. I wrote to ask how to reorder, and this is the only response since then.  Is there anything you can do to change this problem.? Do you reprint reviews of your service
