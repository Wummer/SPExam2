This is just like an updated B movie from the sixties and I enjoyed it.  It's real comic book stuff.  The effects are not bad, the pace hardly flags and the cast seem to be enjoying themselves so it's easy viewing.  I enjoyed this more than big budget films such as Evolution or Jurassic Park 3.  But I think the absence of big names will put people off, not that it matters because the cast here do a fine job.  And if big names don't matter to you then you could do a lot worse than watch this
