I remember taking a minute of my time to watch this dung when it premiered a couple years back, and lets just say I find watching something download more than this. I swear I hate preps the most in this country. 

Yesterday I was at the mall going to the (Unspecified phone company) lot to cancel my Vonage service (Vonage... Sucks... A-S-S... DO NOT LISTEN TO WHAT THEY SAY ON TV! I can't begin to describe how horrible Vonage is!), but to get there I had to venture through the worst part of the mall. As I carried the phone bill, I crept past the K-Swiss windows without a peep. I then leaped from fake palm tree to fake palm tree infront of the Abercrombie A Fitch store, which was infested with teen girls and their sell-out boy friends that think wearing pink is "hot". I then slid down a railing and fell a couple feet short of the Jamba Juice stand. I picked myself up with my remaining strength and threw the smoke bomb I had in my pocket infront me, thus disappearing from the mindless zombies drinking their elixir with the ever-horrendous Down 4 Life playing in the background.

Squash 'N' Squeak below me speaks only the truth! Listen to him too!

It may be hard for you 3-5 star reviewers to accept the fact but then again you can't handle it anyways. Come to your friggen senses and stop wasting you money on this garbage. It's enough acting like you do already, but then you go and spend money on this litter to watch OTHER PEOPLE act like you do! God Damn
