People that love this series are misguided at best...it sucks. I mean completely stinks. I will be putting set on eBay.

I love the Avengers, The Prisoner...and especially!!! Secret Agent and Danger Man. This stuff is brit tv at it's finest. I also like Monty Python and the Chronicles of Narnia...so a brit-hater I'm not.

This series has the most horrific acting, garbage visuals, missing story lines, etc
