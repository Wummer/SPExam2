I am extremely dissappointed with amazon on this one.  This is not the dvd version of the film.  However, on all the links to it, it says "DVD".  When I received the item in the mail, amazon was very ambiguous in helping me with my return, and even told me that they would send the DVD version of the film.  Nonetheless, two days later, I received the same PSP version again.  

Great movie, it's in my top ten.  Amazon screwed up on this one
