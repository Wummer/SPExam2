My daughters are not Barbie doll fans...but they do like the movies. So do I.

All but this one. The Pegasus were beautiful...but it stopped there.

We thought Barbie was too snotty and disrepectful in her manner of speaking. Bring back the nice Barbie!

Her 'boyfriend' was just as snotty.

We didn't like the evil Wenlock...and the way he preys on teenage daughters forcing them into marriage.

In one scene Wenlock throws a tray of food into one of his wives face. That was shocking and sad.

Our copy of this dvd went into the trash
