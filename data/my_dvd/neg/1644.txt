I recently purchased this DVD and was beyond disappointed with it.  I actually ended up fast forwarding just to get through it.  I expected a true documentary with maybe a few interviews with people who were there, with the firemen, or anyone at all but the video is mostly silent.  I can hear the fire fighters radios but most of it is so staticky it's hard to make out.  The film has a few comments by the person taping it but that's it.  The film also pretty much stays focused on just a couple of areas of rubble.  I found nothing at all in this film that brought any emotion to me other than boredom.  I own several other documentaries that I watch over and over as I don't want to forget the feelings I felt on 911 but this film is lacking greatly in bringing any kind of human element to this horror that was inflicted on our country.  This DVD was a HUGE waste of both my time and money.
