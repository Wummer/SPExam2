Don't bother trying to watch this terrible mini series.  It is a six hour bore, an unbelievable love triangle between three people who have absolutely no chemistry for each other.  There is no heat in this story, no real passion, no real romance.  It is a dry, boring, drawn out, and uninspired as they come.  The writing is atrocious, and while the actors should be given credit for not choking on the swill they have for dialogue, they are completely unbelievable.  The story is utterly predictable, though it goes off on pointless tangents and ignores potentially interesting subplots, and the only thing surprising is that anybody ever thought it would be a good idea to make this drivel.  It doesn't even meet the expected level of technical proficiency, with terrible editing, pathetic sound, and blatant continuity problems.  Take those six hours of your life and use them for something more worthwhile.  The BBC has made many better mini series, and pretty much any one of them would be preferable
