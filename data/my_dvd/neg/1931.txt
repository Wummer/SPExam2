THE BAD
I can't say I dislike this item, but I did not like it either. Even though I'm still a novice golfer (score between 95-105) and been playing for about 18 months, I've read a lot of golf fundamentals articles and studied like 4 other DVDs ...(yes I'm an instruction junky) and I can say that this instrutor (Simon Holmes) misses to point out many important fundamental factors that influence a good swing, and even though I like how the DVD has a well structured lesson category listing, he does not explain deeply enough on many things.
The filming production seems to have a good intention for this DVD, but it lacks camera closeups/slowmotions on the ball, clubhead, ball lies and graphical enhancements for better understanding of what he want's to explain. I mean with today's technology on DVD production, this seems to be a cheap one.

THE GOOD
He has very good tips on many subjects that I think they're transparent for a very beginner.
If this is not your first instructional DVD, and just want to gather a new bunch of tips, then buy it. Otherwise a better selection that I can reccomend for a complete golf school DVD, is the Wally Armstrong's Ultimate Golfing Experience. The set is very cheap because it's a compilation of old '80s and 90'videos from that instructor, and from the 5 DVD's in the box, you can thrash 2 if you like, but for $17 bucks...HEY!! is worth it!

I hope this helps and saves you some money
