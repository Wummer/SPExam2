I was so bored by this film that I thought I might be missing some subtle French cultural context or emotional triggers that would make it interesting.  I asked a younger, French, female friend, who said she found it at least as boring as I did.

The characters didn't engage my sympathy.  Nothing explained why these people were even remotely interested in each other, so I didn't care what happened to them.  Scenes like long car drives from the marriage bed to a first infidelity didn't build any dramatic tension or advance a plot or provide any interesting insight into the characters themselves.  The sex scenes were banal and the bondage episodes in particular laughable.

I sat through to the end, thinking there might perhaps be some breathtaking ending to redeem the wasted minutes.  I want my money back.  Plus damages
