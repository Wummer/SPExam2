I never saw the series on tv so when it came out on dvd, I was excited, remembering the magazine from when I was a kid and being a fan of ILC, SNL, and comedy itself.  I am also known for finding various comic styles funny where others don't.  I write this review now as I am TRYING to watch the third disc.  I got the dvd the first day it came out and I have to watch every dvd I get, even if I saw it before.  Regardless to say, I only broke a smurk ONCE throughout the first 2 1/2 discs.  I even tried watching parts of the disc when I was having a great day and even when I was not in the greatest of moods.  I was in a good mood again this morning so I started watching it.  I think it is the lamest show that I have ever seen.  I really don't know why it ever lasted past the first season.  If you've seen the show on tv and you like it, more power to you, if you haven't seen it, don't buy it, it is a waste of money.  Everybody says that after season two is when it gets funny...  I personaly don't think I should have to endure a whole first season for it to get funny
