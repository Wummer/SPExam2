I am still awaiting receiving Dora the Explorer meets Diego.......I have ordered it twice once before Christmas and kept updating my order to ship when received and then I ordered it later and canceled the original order because it looked like it was available and then I got a delay again.......if you have any update on when this will be in and shipped I would really like to know......everything else that I have odered and has come from Toys R Us through Amazon I have been very pleaase with........
