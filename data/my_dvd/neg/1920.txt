This is a potentially very good film. Interesting idea (bearing some resemblance to "Angel heart"). Sadly marred by a quite appauling transfer. I don't think I've ever bought (DVD or video) or seen (TV or cinema) quite such an awful copy of a movie. It is clearly stuck together from more than one original, with the logo "Delta" appearing now and again in the bottom right hand corner, but don't be misled into thinking this is the most complete version. The term "special edition" seems to refer only to the fact that it has been released !!!!! Tony Curtis does an incredibly poor intro and epilogue (clearly from some late night cheap TV series).

Don't buy it.

Maybe there's a better version (I read talk of a "Critereon" disc), maybe not. Still, it really isn't worth (any) money
