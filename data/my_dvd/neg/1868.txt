Yul Brynner stalks about like he's in Westworld, acting super-tough, smoking every chance he gets. Steve McQueen, as always, is terrible. As for the rest of the "7", their acting is atrocious to non-existent. Only Eli Wallach walks away unscathed. Yet if these things are irritating, it is the blatantly sexist and racist undertones to the entire affair that just make it heinous. Yul Brynner actually says that he "might" rape the women of the town in one scene sarcastically. Amazing this could have ever been construed as being "tough". It's just ridiculous, and these distinctions are what sepeartes this pathetic remake from the masterpiece it shames. But I'll give it one extra star for being relatively well staged and directed.
