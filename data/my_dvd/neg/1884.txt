I was very disappointed in this DVD.  It was a DVD for someone who wanted only the very basic information on birds.  The DVD was very short and could have added a lot of expanded details.  The ability to view details of color and details of wing, tail bands, etc would have offered a much better learning tool.  It also could have had the bird call longer throughout a longer display of bird colorations
