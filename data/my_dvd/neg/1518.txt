Old movies are great.  I've been waiting for the release of Oklahoma! in the new technology DVD format - I wanted to use my new DVD up-converter.  I have the Laser Disk version, and after reading the reviews, I will keep it until Fox gets its act totether.  Fox should have a press release when they fix the problems reviewed here - until I know it's AT LEAST as good as my outdated Laser Disk, I'll wait
