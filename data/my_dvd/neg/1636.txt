 Since we know there is another version of "Burn" out there,i would suggest you wait for it and check rotten tomatoes.com and get an idea of its quality.You can not judge the quality of this film by the pan and scan,poorly coordinated color transfer that sony has issued.Brando told larry king it was his favorite film;not if he saw this package
