So I bought this movie because some of the reviews said that the acting was terrible but the dancing was amazing.  
Well, anyone who thinks that the salsa dancing in this movie is amazing, awesome, good, or ok, has never actually SEEN salsa dancing!!
I am a salsa dancer, and this movie was HORRIBLE!!!  I have seen amazing dancing, and good dancing.  This was TERRIBLE dancing!  And there was hardly any salsa!
It was 80s dancing to salsa music!  That's IT.  The only time there was actually salsa dancing was when the main character was training with the club owner.  Other than that, it was just 80s dancing to salsa music.  That's it.  
If you want to see salsa dancing, I DEFINITELY DO NOT recommend this movie.  
If you want to see horrible acting, and old 80s dancing, then I recommend this movie...
There was only one thing that I liked about this movie.  The appearances made by Tito Puente and Celia Cruz.  That was great to see, but not worth buying the movie for....  
Oh, and the story line?  What was it again????  
Yeah...
I love movies, good ones and bad ones.
But this one???  The WORST movie I have seen so far...

To the best of my knowledge, there aren't actually any movies with really good salsa dancing. 
Hopefully, someday, there will be
