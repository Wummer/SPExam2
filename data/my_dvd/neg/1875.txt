I didn't think of it much as a movie as I did a porn frenzy. I'm very much interested in history and also psychology and neither was apparent to me in this movie other than we know Caligula was nuts. Otherwise, then I guess so was all of the Roman Empire. I simply cannot believe one stroll down the streets would produce such frenzy. It was stupid, simple and as soon as it was done I immediately threw it out. Not for the faint of heart. Not for the sophisticated either. Or anywhere in between.
