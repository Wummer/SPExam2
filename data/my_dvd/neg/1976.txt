YES! 
I agree with the other reviewers!
This is the one VanDamm movie I LOVE and when I found it in my one used shop I was so extatic I never looked to see screen format! I never though that it would be Full Screen@!#!*!%!!!!!

Ye Gods!
it totally ruins that wonderful sceen in the kitchen of him doing the splits!
Hey ya I'm a red-blooded female...and I can go OUCH at that scene too! that stunt hurts to do and man.....Whistle.....Looks very nice!
The cropping really really ruins the impressive impact of that scene and I've not see the picture since it first came out

it was really a Disappointment when I saw FULL SCREEN 

Come on UNIVERSAL!!!

WE WANT WIDE SCREEN!
FULL PICTURE!!!!

this is a fantastic action picture and a crying shame to see it in full screen only!!!!!
