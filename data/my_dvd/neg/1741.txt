This review might contain some spoilers....I was disappointed with this anime. After all the reviews I read I was expecting alot more. It was slow in some parts and granted you knew somehow she would have to die considering her contract with a demon Chrono she just all of a sudden gets a stigmata and it is pretty much over. There was some humor but all in all I would not waste money on it. Infact, I took my collection down to the local half price books and sold it the day after I purchased it
