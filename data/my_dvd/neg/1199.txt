All of them are special editions and I've not the listed reduced private seller price, thats the straight up corporate sham price. I regularly shop for awards/trophys and I couldn't imagine a pretty case with plate gold finish costing more than 80 bucks thats 287.93 You could still take your sweetheart to the movies and Benigans for some baked potato soup for this inflated price. I'm not sure .. But I don't THINK this case is platinum, makes you look any younger, make you fly or will help you sleep better so .. I think I've made my point
