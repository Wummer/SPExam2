I love TNG, DS9, and I even quite like a few of the characters in Enterprise. But I HATE Voyager. Why? One simple reason - Janeway. I cant stand her. She makes me want to puke. She has only two personas in the entire 7-year series and she constantly alternates between them, and they are both nauseating. First, vomit-inducing Compassion-face in which she puts on this phony 'caring' face and talks in a 'caring' gentle whisper. Two, tough-chick-face in which she puts on a hard-chick scowl and speaks in a deeper hard-chick voice that is not in the slightest bit believable. God she nauseates me. The same thing happened with Maggie Thatcher. The one time the dumbasses put a woman at the helm and she totally ruins everything. Unlike Kirk, Picard, Sisko and even Archer, Janeway has no charisma at all. Yuck. But shes not the only one, this has got to be the only Star Trek series in which no matter how hard I tried I could never develop any attachment to the characters. They're all boring. Only Paris has any appeal and even then not much. I watched the first 3 seasons hoping I would grow to like this garbage and finally gave up. Years later I finally came back and decided to give the final season a try in the hope that the characters might have developed over the years. No. The same old nauseating Janeway, same old boring episodes, spewing over with self-righteousness and endless lectures about human 'morality'. And this series is the most mushy, sentimental crap of all the Star Trek series. There is barely an episode that is not cringe-inducing in its emotional mushyness. The only moments in the entire seventh series that were worth watching was the 'Q2' episode and that was only because Q was in it (and they even turned that into a morality play), and the very end of 'Renaissance Man' when the Doctor tells Harry that his saxophone playing sounded like a wounded Targ. Good riddance Voyager, and especially good riddance Janeway
