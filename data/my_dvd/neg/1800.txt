You know, Shrek 2 is the embarassment of American culture. What's wrong with it you ask? Let's see... too much slapstick humor, too many movie references, or parodies, and an unforgiving act of making fun of or parodying CLASSIC DISNEY CHARACTERS!!! That's just unbelievable, Dreamworks! Disney animation has revolutionized the animation industry, and you just make fun of them. That's a real shame. You should be thanking Disney for all what animation offers nowadays. Disney classics have heart, humor, and a beautiful story. Shrek 2 lacks that. Shrek 2 deserves to be taken away from everybody and stored in a government facility, never to be seen again!!
