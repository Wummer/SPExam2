I am a yoga instructor and I bought this DVD hoping to gain insights to teach to beginning students. This DVD is NOT a real yoga session and the word yoga should not even be in the title! What I did see was a woman who was very flexible, quite possibly a dancer, doing a workout routine that incorporated some yoga movements. In most of the movements she taught, this instructor was hyperextended and moving in very fast repetitive motion.
Pass this one up!
