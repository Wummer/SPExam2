I agree, these were not used in the first two seasons for a good reason, they are not that good.  OK, there is maybe one or two slightly funny sketches but it is not worth buying.  I love Charlie Murphy and the Ashy guy and I think they could have done more with these guys to make it funny.  Dave, come back to TV
