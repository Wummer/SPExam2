I thought this video was really going to encourage my toddler to use his potty but it didn't.  This video has good songs and characters but it only has two short scenes where a puppet is using the potty.  I was expecting a scene where the child can be taken step by step on how to use the potty.  this video didn't do it, so I'm still in the search of a video that really enphasizes potty trainning.  Todlers need visuals and actions, the bear on this video does more talking than actual actions
