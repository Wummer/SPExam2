I agree with others! Season by season BOX SETS of Beavis A Butt-Head are what we fans want! With all music and BAB commentary and no damned edits of anything!

Until then, Mike Judge A company, I will NOT buy anything BAB related, relying instead on my own VHS recorded episodes(limited in number of episodes as they are at least they're the complete original episodes)that I've transfered to DVD.

I want each and every episode uncut and in their original broadcast order.

Who's the brains behind the lame "Mike Judge Collection" series anyway?!? Some dumbass idiot working at Burger World??? 

Just from a purely greedy standpoint you'd make way more greenbacks by doing it the right way for cryin' out loud! Not to mention retain the show's and your integrity. 

Hell, even Beavis and Butt-Head'd think this "Collection" concept'd be lame and stupid!!

Get with the groove Mike A Co. and give us what we want already!!
