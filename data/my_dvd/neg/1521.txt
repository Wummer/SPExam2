This is the worst Asian movie that I have ever seen.  The story is dumb and doesn't make any sense, especially the ending.  And to top it off it isn't that scary - it only gets a little bit scary at the end.

My recommendation:  Don't get this movie.  It is also too expensive.  It you want to watch a good Asian horror movie, I have lots of recommendations.  Wishing Stairs is pretty good.  Koma is an excellent movie. A Tale of Two Sisters is pretty good. Good luck
