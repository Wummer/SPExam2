GROWING UP, I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THE TURTLES BUT THIS DVD STINKS.  THE ONLY PLUS IS THAT I CAN HAVE THE ORIGINAL EPISODES IN CONVENIENT DVD FORM RATHER THAN TRACK DOWN A BUNCH OF OLD VHS TAPES.  THIS DVD IS NO DIFFERENT FROM THE SEASON ONE AND SEASON THREE DVD'S.  THEY ALL HAVE SPELLING ERRORS AND TITLE ERRORS AND EACH ONE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN PRODUCE IN A HALF-A$$ FASHION JUST TO CAPITALIZE ON THE NEW TURTLE'S SUCESS.  WHICH BY THE WAY THE NEW TURTLES ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THE OLD ONES.  ON THE SEASON THREE DVD THE PACKAGE REFERS TO "BEBOP" AS BEBOB, NICE EDITING JOB. I GUESS IT WAS TO HARD TO GET THAT ONE RIGHT.  ALSO ALL THREE OF THE DVD'S ARE BARE BONES WITH NO SPECIAL FEATURES.  THE PRICE DOES HOWEVER REFLECT THE CRAPPY JOB THE STUDIO DID ON THIS MOST OF THESE DVD'S CAN BE PURCHASED FOR AROUND 10 BUCKS.  I JUST WISH THAT PETER LAIRD HAD THE RIGHTS TO THE OLD SHOW SO THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE SOME JUSTICE ON DVD
