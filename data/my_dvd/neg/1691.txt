The details are all fine if you don't know the middle east - but are not well researched and inconsistent.  I won't bore you with the list.  

All the big picture takeaway is that the middle east and big oil are a complicated business with many parties that have a big stake.  Tell us something new.  

The overall storyline does not have much else going for it - I was expecting more intrigue, a more synthesized story line.  A disappointment.
