HEY GENIUS. GOOD JOB RUINING THE END OF THE MOVIE FOR ANYONE WHO HASN'T SEEN IT. LIKE, SAY, MY FIVE YEAR OLD AND EIGHT YEAR OLD CHILDREN. IT'S A MIRACLE IF I CAN EVEN GET THEM TO SIT STILL FOR FIVE MINUTES, AND NOW THAT THEY KNOW THE ENDING TO THIS FILM, THERE'S NO WAY THEY'RE EVER GOING TO AGREE TO GO TO BED TONIGHT. THANKS A BUNCH. EVER HEARD OF THE INTERNET BEFORE? YOU MUST BE A FIRST TIME USER.
