I just rented this video for my 14 month old daughter.  I was disappointed with the 4 dollars I spent on it for that.  It is more like a music video than a story.  The segments are of adults, no children singing or playing and the story line isn't much.  Sure my daughter swayed along with the music but there wasn't anything educational about this video and I am so glad I didn't buy it.  I really limited my daughters exposure to tv and this was the first video we ever left her watch and now I'm sorry that we did even that.  Stick with the sesame street tv program or prescreen other dvds before you buy.  I hope this helps you from being as disappointed as we were.
