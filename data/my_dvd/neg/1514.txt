The movie itself is just as good i remembered it.  But the Criterion Collection DVD package, however, is so totally not worth the $40 plus postage i paid for it.  I've gotten so much more bang for my buck with other "special edition"-type DVDs.  i found the interviews and "extra" stuff dull.  I want my money back
