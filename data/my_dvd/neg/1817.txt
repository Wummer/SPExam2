This late Keaton material - when the actor desperately needed funds - is so asinine and unoriginal you will writhe along with Keaton rolling in his grave at this release.

The cover art was so deceptive that I bought into the DVD collection being some obscure works from the silent era.  Nope.  The producers of this release went to painstaking steps to conceal the nature of this material.  It comes from Keaton's last gasp on the screen: skits so insanely stupid you will pity both Keaton and yourself for buying this crap
