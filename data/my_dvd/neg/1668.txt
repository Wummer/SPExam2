There is one thing I finally grasped upon watching 'The 40 Year Old Virgin', however.  I came to the realization that Hollywood has to remake movies now over and over and over again because the films that try to be unique ('The 40 Year Old Virgin') are so awful that studio heads need to go elsewhere for their ideas.

Of course, they're laughing all the way to the bank because the brain dead inside and outside of the continental United States will be for, and laugh at, anything.

This film is popular because Steve Carrell makes the same faces and has the same delivery that he did/does on 'The Office', and people just love those mannerisms (Ricky Gervals is better in the same role, by the way...but that's neither here nor there).   It certainly couldn't be because it's funny.

The general concept of a 40 year old virgin has promise.  That concept added with the most boiled down Middle School potty jokes is not.  

That concept added to a girl who wants to take him home but is too drunk to drive, yet she does it anyway and runs into dozens of objects is not.  

That concept added with a cross eyed Asian woman waxing his hairy chest while they show extreme close up's of Carrells large nose as he screams vulgarities into the lens is not.

That concept added with 60 year old Middle Eastern Salesmen using every sexual metaphor out loud is not.

You get the drift.  Maybe the boat left and I wasn't on the boat.  Maybe I'm not 12 years old anymore and am amused by jokes you used to hear outside at recess playing tether ball and eating Chocodiles.

If you like juvenile humor, watch something like 'Better Off Dead' or 'Caddyshack'.  Watch a movie that doesn't have to try so hard to write something vulgar to get a laugh.

Sincerely,

Bill Cosb
