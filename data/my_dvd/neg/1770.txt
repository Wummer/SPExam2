I really hate how all these exercise videos are repackaged and called something different.  It's damn confusing.

At any rate, just be aware that if you buy "Sleek Physique"  (ALSO called "SLIM Physique" in different packaging!) from Karen Voight you are getting to same stuff  from this DVD.

Shame
