I first saw the movie poster and wasn't particlularly inspired by the idea of cows going after an evil cow rustler. But then I heard composer Alan Menken (who had worked on Beauty A The Beast and Aladdin) was attached and this made me rethink my position. Then unfortunately the trailer made me rethink my position back to what it was before. Still, I went into the movie theater ready to give "Home On The Range" a chance... 

...and fell asleep. I found the soundtrack uninspired and the story incredibly weak. I admit the animation is fine (but not spectacular) and some of the jokes are funny but they are very few and far between. Apparently "Home On The Range" was meant to be released before "Brother Bear" but because of story issues it was delayed. I don't think it should have been made in the first place. It has also ruined the work laid out by "Brother Bear" for a new Disney renaissance. I think whoever said yes to this movie should be fired, because not only is it terrible, but it ended mainstream 2-D animation for Disney, a massive loss to the entertainment industry.

The DVD has an audio commentary (with rather overconfident directors if you ask me considering this movie is a disaster). There is also a behind the scenes featurette, games, art review and music video- more than this movie that never should have happened deserves.
