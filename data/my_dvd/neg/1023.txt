I'm a language teacher and I have a number of DVDs that I use at school as language tools.  DVDs are great because they're inexpensive teaching aids when it comes to foreign languages...but only when the DVDs actually have other tracks than English.  Nowadays practically every released movie has language tracks and sometimes subtitles in other languages but this DVD seems like a hearkening back to the dark ages when people were lucky just to get a movie on this format and no extra effort whatsoever was put into a movie's release on DVD.  I was pretty disappointed to discover just as the DVD was shipping that it wasn't what I thought it was going to be.  I suppose it's my fault for assuming, but I feel ripped off just the same
