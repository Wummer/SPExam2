So disappointing. Hardly a dark/noir film, in my opinion. Just a proper Hollywood murder mystery. And there's no sex, except brief kissing which Lana always cuts short!  I'm a James M Cain fan, and this doesn't even try to be faithful to his great noir novel. Everyone's too decent. Cora (Lana) doesn't have a treacherous or naughty bone in her body, and she's always costumed like a perfect fashion model, fingernail polish and all.  Frank (Garfield)is never lustful, never mean, never desperate.  Always polite and decent. Not a gas station (except for one pump that looks planted) not a single oil can or wrench.  Not a greasy spoon or diner, Twin Oaks looks like a tidy clean beach cottage or BAB, fit for Donna Reed A family.  The 80's Nicholson/Mammet version is much better in all these areas and actually dark.  Much more faithful to Cain
