What were they thinking?!  There are actually scenes DELETED from the original theatrical release!!  The extended edition is an "abomination" if there ever were one.  

Furthermore, I discourage anyone who has not seen the original from purchasing this product.  Seek out the original release because I believe the "original" release included in this set is not of the same quality.

David Lynch was right in not becoming involved in this edition
