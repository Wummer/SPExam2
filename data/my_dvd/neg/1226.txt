This movie was obviously made by Japanese fans of several American films.  It then tried to mix them all together in one film. 

The main ones are the Matrix, Reservoir Dogs, and Night of the Living Dead.  Especially the Matrix.

We have several yakuza meeting at a specified location where they usually bury their victims, the location turns out to be a forest of reincarnation so their victims are coming back to life.

Then it is a dead-come-back-to-life genre gore film heavy with feuding Yakuza elements.

Our main character has the long black Matrix type coat and general emotionless demeanor.   The high-tech 360 camera movements of the Matrix are blatantly being imitated minus the high-tech aspect.  Instead it is obvious that the camera itself is being moved 360 around the action.

I really hated the Matrix so a film mainly paying tribute to the Matrix already has a big strike against it.

As for the other elements, they were all brought in awkwardly and it just seemed to constantly extend the story with another element of their favorite American movies that they wanted to include.

The gore was mostly uncreative and uninteresting.

Note that if you are looking for something different than typical American movies by checking out those wacky Japanese movies, you will not get it here
