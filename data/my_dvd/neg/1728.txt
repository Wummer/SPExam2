I am a BBC devotee and officionado and purchased this dvd sight unseen because it seemed to ooze of excellent epic BBC storytelling and visual feasting.   However, I was only partially correct.  It is excellently produced and beautiful to behold but the story is depressing and even a bit silly. I left the film feeling robbed, disappointed, sad, and a bit unfulfilled.  I viewed it only once and then sold it on e-bay at a cut-rate price.
