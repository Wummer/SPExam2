From a big JT, Brit, and X-tina fan:  This DVD is soooo disappointing.  The DVD is comprised of whole episodes of MMC- and very little of the episodes has Britney, Justin, or Christina featured.  There is only one song where Brit and Justin sing (a duet), and only one where Christina sings.  Other than that, all they basically show are lame "hometown profiles" which last about 60 seconds each.  You get better content from a "Behind the Music" or "Driven" episode.   There's even some really heavy stuff about teens committing suicide that has absolutely NOTHING to do with Britney, Justin, or Christina.  Lame, lame, lame, and disappointing.  I think the total on-screen time of real content is about 12 minutes.  Save your money
