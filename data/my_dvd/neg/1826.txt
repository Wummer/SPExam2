Except for the presence of Kevin Bacon, whom I like a lot, this would have been a real loser.  There were so many things wrong.  Directed by Paul Glaser with no surprises, no depth of character, a too heavy-handed Hollywood scenario.  You knew what was coming a mile away.  There was good cinematography and music, and Kevin Bacon is always appealing, but that's the best I can say.  Oh, and the nun.  She was pretty good too.  The lead black man was also engaging; the problem was really the script.  Too pat, and too many unbelievable things that screamed "Hollywood".  Like when the village burned down.  They were ready to just up and leave where they'd lived for generations.  As if it takes generations to rebuild their houses.  And there were no signs of the burned buildings during the basketball game.  And Bacon was supposed to climb this incredible mountain, get cut in the groin, then play basketball, all on a rotten knee.  Please
