I received this DVD from my brother who is possibly a bigger Kevin Smith fan than I am. I thought the fact that he was  giving away his copy was pretty odd at the time until I watched the DVD myself. 

The Degrassi episodes are amazingly boring and Jay and Silent Bob's toned-down appearances don't help much. I really liked the original Degrassi series so I was disappointed by this DVD. 

There are some funny moments in the "Extras" section of the DVD but I would still only recommend this as a "rent" or something to buy used if you are a diehard fan.
