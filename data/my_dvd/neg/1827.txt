lately im getting bored with most of the movies that come out, ot it's me that im losing the charm for watching movies... and it more into the first one...

i bought this one, 'cause i thought it was gonna be great. good critics, good   reviews.

i finally watched it. and i thought it was some slasher film. some kinda that... and i was totally wrong... some witch movie that i hated...

i could rate it less, but well i'll give it a second chance tonight
