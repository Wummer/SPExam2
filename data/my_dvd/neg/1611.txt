What looks like a good movie to watch quickly turns into disappointment. Whilst you expect some plot to come together (at least on first viewing) - it is strung together to confuse - even to frustrate the viewer.

I was given no warning about the really really bad quality. Having a HD Large display does not help either. The sound is annonying as is irritating. In fact I got a refund on the movie hire!

I don't expect overboard special effect and CGI overlays. I expected the quality to be above a cheap CAM recorder however.

The plot is complicated and the noise in the background adds to the disorientation which is done on purpose.

On the other note: The cheap and nasty props do not add anything to crediblility either.

Stay clear - but if you have the time and want to view the movie - settle back and expect a "student" movie from some high School college.

This movie although good in concept fails. I would like some production house to take it on board - create the situation with some convinving special effects (to help the storyline), better sound, widescreen and convincing props.

It could have been a brilliant movie but is spoiled by bad quality and unconvinving props.
