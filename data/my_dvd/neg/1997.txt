I am a big fan of martial arts films  --  having lived in Taiwan.  However, this one was over-hyped in my opinion.  The love affairs in the DVD were unbelievable at best and even absurd at times.  I often enjoy the melodrama and over-acting of Chinese films, but I gagged a few times on this one.  It was down-right goofy at times.  I really wanted this one to grab me, but it did not.
