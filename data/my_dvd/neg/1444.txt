The video in this DVD looks as though it was put through a simple computer program that decoded it for going on to a DVD disc. A standard 4.7GB disc, by the way; that's what you'll get when you buy this.

I say this because I've used those programs before and know how they alter the video. This is how they alter it, and how it looks on this USA release of the DVD:

Skin color is too red. Dark (shadowed) areas are greenish. White/beige is pinkish. Grey is bluish. White has blue on it. The colors are just totally messed up.

Evidence of grey being blue = look at Robert Duvall's uniform (you'll see him 3 minutes into the movie). The german uniform is a semi-light grey. It is too dark and filled with blue.

Then look behind him at the wall. A lovely dark shadow of green.

Evidence of white/beige being pinkish, when Robert Duvall walks into that office, look at the walls. They should be a kind of white/beige color but they are not a shade of white at all, they are pinkish.

As he walks into the office to sit down, you see curtains on the wall in the office. They are supposed to be white, but they're filled with blue.

At 48 minutes into the movie, you see Donald Sutherland sitting in the grass with the character Molly. His suit is supposed to be black. Look at it. It's purple. That is not black.

On top of all that, the movie is too dark. There should have been a brightness/contrast adjustment. If you pay attention to dark areas in the movie, such as fixtures around a room or an office, most times, they are pitch black and indistinguished. For example, look at desk drawers, telephones, vases, black hair, black jackets..even Robert Duvall's eye patch. Not much shading, usually pitch black.

I've read that this movie apparently was not remastered for the North American release.

I plan to get the Region 2 (Europe) release. I'd rather do without watching it on my TV and watch it on my computer in better, "proper" quality.

'Nuff said
