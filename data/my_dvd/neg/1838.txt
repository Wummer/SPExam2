Teenagers plan a mock crime for kicks on the same day criminals knock off a bank for real and their paths cross.  I can understand implying that two ex-cons have or had a homosexual relationship but to lace an entire movie  with cheap double-entendre and to stoop so low as to give a lead male  character a female first name is a trifle ridiculous (OK, director we 'get  it' all men are secretly gay! You made your point, move on!) I can't even  imagine that a person of same gender orientation could possibly find this  film the least bit interesting much less stimulating. (for an intelligent  crime caper with a same-sex subplot see Aquot;BoundAquot;)  Since this  movie is supposed to take place in Wisconsin they give the locals a  Southern accent.  An absolute bore
