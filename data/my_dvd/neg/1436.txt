This disc is like a Whitman's candy sampler:  It has a lot of different things... but a lot of the things you don't really want.  The film covers kids, high schoolers, college ball and college recruiting/pay controversies, ABA, NBA through all its decades, Harlem Globetrotters, the street game and inner-city stars, country boys, Indiana basketball, retired old timers hanging in Florida, current stars, marketing (are there ANY hoop videos that don't talk about sneaker brands), public relations, fireworks, cheerleaders, guys on trampolines, women's basketball..... Whew.  None of these subjects is studied in depth.  If you've followed basketball for a while, you know and have seen most of this.  The subject sampling seems to jump all over the place, so it would be hard to hit chapters to see just what you want.  I'd rather see a DVD star profile (Jordon, Iverson) or Aquot;NBA at 50Aquot; or Spike Lee's movie, or Aquot;Hoop Dreams,Aquot; etc.  1 Love is such a sampler it feels like the disc should come free with the purchase of a Wilson basketball.  Or it seems like something you'd see on Sunday TV, after most people have turned off their sets when the real game ends.  In short, Aquot;1 LoveAquot; is a decent sampling, but nothing to sink your teeth into
