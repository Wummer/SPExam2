Yeeouch! Think "I Spit on Your Grave" with a very good art director.  "Audition" for the Lolita set.  If you feel Kevin Bacon got off too easy in "The Woodsman," or you enjoy sitting through entire "Law and Order: SVU" marathons on TNT, this film has something for you.  Everyone else be advised to stay far, far away
