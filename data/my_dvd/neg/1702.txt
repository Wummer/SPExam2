I recently discovered this set available on DVD and was very excited, since I've been a fan of David Suchet, Agatha Christie and Hercule Poirot for a long time.  I was really looking forward to viewing these, however the poor quality of the image was apparent to me in the first scene and it didn't get better.  The image quality is actually worse than what I've seen on aired on television via cable.  The picture appears to be composed of thousands of tiny vertical lines, which are easily discernable and difficult to ignore.  I'm amazed Acorn would release such a great series in such a low quality package and then charge so much for it.  I will definitely not buy any other titles by Acorn Media
