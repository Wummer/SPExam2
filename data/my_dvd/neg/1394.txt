This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The only thing that stopped me from demanding my money back at the end was the fact that I saw it in a free sneak preview.

By the end of movie you don't like any of the characters and you don't care what happens to them, even the ones that started out sympathetic and likable.  The third time Jack Nicholson's character gets beaten with his own golf clubs you're torn between wishing they'd just kill him already and wishing they'd kill you instead so you don't have to sit through anymore of this crap.

Save your time and your money, turn around and walk away from this one.  I wish I had
