This is the kind of morbid/vulger trash that Warner Brothers does now.  With them it's a show that is full of sex, graphic content, and a life style that is really damging to one's mental and physical health.  This show and it's studio are no better then Disney and their Desperate Housewives show that treats women like call girls.  It's all represents a Hollywood that is out of control and completely gone off the edge.  I condem them both
