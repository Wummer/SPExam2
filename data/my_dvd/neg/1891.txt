I am a big fan of faerietales and stories for children, though I do not have any of my own.  On the whole I am unimpressed with the Barbie series which is highly unoriginal with characters that seem as plastic as the dolls themselves.

While it manages to be more of a sedative than a painful experience, it is not something that I would recommend to other lovers of faerietales and/or faerie lore.  

Children, however, are often attracted to brightly colored things with simple stories, and will most likely love it
