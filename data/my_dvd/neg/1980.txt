(1) Scarlett O'Hara is the least likable "heroine" I've ever seen. She has no redeeming qualities.
(2) We're supposed to sympathize with the South and feel nostalgia for the good old days when white folks could own black folks?
(3) This movie is way too long and dull.
(4) I'm glad they burned Atlanta to the ground.
(5) There was nothing honorable or respectable about the Old South and the plantation way of the life. The "gentlemen" were nothing but racists who thought they were aristocrats because blacks did all their work for them.
(6) I'd rather watch "Mandingo" than this racist garbage any day of the week
