This final season is just ridiculous...and not in a good way. 

When the Wayans abandon a project, then you know it is unfunny and over. Just look at the Scary Movie films.

Kelly Coffield left because the producers wanted to use Alexandra Wentworth more. A huge mistake! Kelly was hilarious.

Save your money and avoid this stinker season
