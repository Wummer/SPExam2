i actually saw this movie when i was 7 and it freaked me out abit, but i mean the brother was basically a blob with a face and the story was as bad as the acting. The ending was garbage and it had nothing to offer in todays world.Dont even rent this, i dont even know why you are considering the film.

I only give it a 2 star rating because t managed to scare a seven year old and i havent forgot how dumb the film was since.
