Not only does the new music change the mood and quality of critical scenes, it's tantamount to watching old Batman episodes. As soon as something develops, in comes the cheesy music...
The added scenes were poorly produced which is why they didn't make the original cut...The interviews seemed contrived. 
I'm not impressed. 
The older version supersedes the new
