For me this movie is a painfull thing to watch. I wish that I could give this 0 stars. The infamous fake "O" scene kind of recked true intamacy for me. It may be true that women do this but it is one of the worst kind of lie imaginable. 

One of the truths for us guys is that when we are cuddiling with a woman we fanasise that we are with the first girl we fell in love with. 

Just FYI.
