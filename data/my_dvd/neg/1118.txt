Can't remember when I've seen a film with more depraved and pathetic characters than this.   A has-been silent screen star who lives in a sinister dark house surrounded by a gzillion of her own photos and a weirdo butler essentially kidnap a holiday screen writer, down on his luck.  The writer wanders onto what appears to be deserted property, and hides his car trying to escape a Finance Co. The  threesome make the creepiest trio you could ever imagine.   In one early scene they have a funeral, casket and all, for a monkey.  Yuk.  

Gloria Swanson was directed to play a woman who still thinks she can make a come back by writing her own script, though she despises movies that "talk".   She waves her hands about, and makes strange corny expressions with her face in every scene. She falls for the screen writer, William Holden, and won't let him out of her sight.  The film was made in 1950, and Swanson is supposed to be playing a woman of only 50, not exacty over the hill (if we look at many of today's movie stars.)   But she's treated in the film as though she much, much older.  I thought she was supposed to be about 75 or so, but her age is mentioned towards the end of the film.  My heavens, at 50 she could still be in movies, and from the amount of money she apparently had, didn't need to be living in such a dark, creepy house.  Film didn't make sense.   

Sorry I bought it.  It was ridiculous.
