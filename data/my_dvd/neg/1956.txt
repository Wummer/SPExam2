I was thrilled when I saw there was a new Sesame Street Christmas DVD out as my 3 and 6 year olds have the other three memorized.  And, as much as I enjoy being a Sesame Street Kid (37, just like the show), I was tiring of the same stuff over and over.  

Imagine my surprise, then, when virtually all of this DVD is just the highlights of the others (Classic Ernie, Bert and the beloved Mr. Hooper from _Christmas Eve_, Hanukkah from _Happy Holidays_, and Bob singing "All though the Year" from _Elmo Saves Christmas" among others).  The only new part is Christmas future and it is a poor cartoon instead of new muppet footage.  

If you don't have the other three DVDs this would probably earn 4 stars.  If you do have the other DVDs this is not a necessity.  Hopefully next time the budget will allow Sesame Workshop to be more creative
