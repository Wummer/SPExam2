I was excited when this movie showed up in the mail and immediately put it in my DVD player and sat down to watch.  It didn't take long for me to realize it was a cheaply made film.  The story was interesting and had it been done in a better way, the film could have been great but after having seen movies such as Trick and Latter Days where the acting and production quality were very good, I found myself feeling dissapointed after only a few moments.  It is not a movie I would readily recommend
