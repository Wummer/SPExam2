The plot of "Hard Target" has been summarized in previous reviews, so I'll limit myself to discussing my favorite part.
"Hard Target's" claim to fame when it came out was that it was John Woo's first American film, and that's certainly a big deal.  (I just saw "Hard Boiled" the other day, and I'd need seven dictionaries to describe that glorious mess.)
But it boggles my mind that Lance Henriksen's jaw-dropping death scene doesn't land right at the top of every review of this movie. I mean... (spoiler alert) the dude has a grenade dropped into his pants.  He manages to get the grenade *out* of his pants before it explodes.  And then he throws it away from him, right? Wrong!  He UNSCREWS the grenade, hoping to separate the fuse from the explosive.  And he DOES separate them before the grenade goes off and starts laughing in triumph.  But he holds the fuse like two inches from the explosive and... THE SPARK JUMPS ACROSS!  Funny enough already, but L.H. makes this shocked "Whu..." sound that is more hysterical than the entire first season of the Daily Show.  Right before blowing up.  It's absolutely brilliant.
