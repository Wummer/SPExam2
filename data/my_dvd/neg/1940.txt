I do not like the format of the DVD at all.  I had taken several Pilates classes before buying this DVD, but I found it difficult to remember exactly what to do in each pose since all of the instruction is at the end.  Much of Pilates is in the finer points like breathing correctly and making sure to squeeze at the right times, so with no reminder of what I should be doing in each pose I felt like I was being cheated out of a workout.  I don't think that having no interruption is worth sacrificing form, so this DVD will be stored away while I learn the specifics of Pilates elsewhere
