This series might be considered a classic if watched by a 12-year-old, but adults will see though the indistinct plot and characters. Most of the plot's famous "unpleasantness" is just tacked on to the main story, and is of no significance.

Apart from putting several of the characters though lots of physical abuses, nothing much gets accomplished thought the series. The main female character clocks about 100 words of dialog across the entire series, so don't bother waiting for any meaningful information from her. The male lead has the typical task of pointing out all the flaws in the alternate world he's been transported to, inbetween having the stuffing beaten out of him.

The most arbitrary abuses are handed out to a young woman, who's included in the story for no reason except to be abused- you can almost hear the writers saying, "I got it! Let's rape a little girl, that'll make it REAL! Yeah, Yeah, I like it!" Having served her purpose, the character then vanishes until being plopped back in near the end of the series, so a little more misery can be dumped on her.

All the characters suffer from lack of depth and motivation. The releative standout would be the villian, who suffers from bipolarism, and alternates between terror, anger, delight, and misery, somtimes all within the same scene. Too bad that was about all he did in the show.

Well, that's about enough. If you have an appetite for "Kid saves alternate universe" themed anime, then you may like this. But I found it lifeless and massively overrated
