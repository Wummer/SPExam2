I can't imagine why Madonna, Janet Jackson, or Michael Jackson's VMA performances were not included in this DVD.  The most influential artists in videos and performance were excluded.  I don't understand.  It is a travesty.  I hope MTV releases more of the VMA performances with Madonna, Janet, and Michael.  I'll buy this one in hopes they will release a really great complilation of VMA performances
