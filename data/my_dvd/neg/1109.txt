I have only one question about this movie. And that is, Why in the world did they change so many things that were in the book? 

If you haven't read the book than you don't know what I'm talking about. But if you have, then you do.

I can't even begin to explain how good of a movie this would've been if it had been adapted correctly. Half the time while watching this, I felt as if I was watching Teletubies or something, the colors were so bright.

If this movie had been placed in the correct time period with correct costumes, locations, characters, and details from the story,then EVERYONE would love it. Not just 5 year olds. 

It makes me so angry when I watch this movie. Yes, its funny and charming but it is so embarrassing. Everytime I loan someone the book, I have to explain to them that it is nothing like the movie at all. In fact, it is a hundred times better. More even. 

I am really disappointed. I just don't get how Gail Carson Levine would agree to all the changes that were made. If someone ever gets the courage to adapt the book into another movie, than I suggest they do it right. And if they do, then I'll be very thankful.

I just don't get it. The book is soooooooooooooooooooooooooo much better. You wouldn't believe how much better it is. 

I am truely ashamed that this movie is even related in any way to the book. Next time, please, please, do it right
