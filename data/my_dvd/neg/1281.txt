This is the classic WW2 submarine war movie, and most WW2 submarine vets will tell you that this is the best movie.  I greatly enjoyed it and it is true sub action, based on what I read about WW2 submarines.  The special effects are a bit cheesy, you can see the wires pulling the torpedos and you can tell that they used scaled model ships...but if you overlook those items, you get fine acting and a good plot with plenty of
action
