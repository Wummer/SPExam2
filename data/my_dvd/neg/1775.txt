This is not about Riverdance.

This is about what this disc did to murder it.

I popped it in, expecting to seemy favorite dance scenes (while conveiniently skipping the singing), when all of a sudden I'm at the finale.  All I could say was "WTF?!", "WTH?!", or words to that effect.

This "SuperBit" edition cuts out half -- HALF -- of the scenes this performance had to offer, including (but certainly notlimited to) Riverdance and Trading Taps.

Not only that, but (unless the "high def" only works for high-end TVs) the video quality is equal to my old VHS copy.

I sincerely hope this problem only occurs on my copy, but I suggest to get a refund webpage ready, because the atrocious product I received royally screws this great perform up the ---
