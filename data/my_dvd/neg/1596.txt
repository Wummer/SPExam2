This movie is not very realistic.  The sets are great!, but the story is a Biblical SNAFU!  They had the chance to embellish the real story, without compromizing the Bible's account, but chose instead to incorporate incidents that were thousands of years later, which impeached any incredibility it might have had. I didn't like it much for that reason.
