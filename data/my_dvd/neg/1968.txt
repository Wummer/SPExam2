ROYAL WEDDING isn't on DVD yet. That's because the OWNER of the film, Warner Bros. hasn't released it yet.

But several other companies have, under the "guise" of public domain. The original copyright on the film was not renewed properly with the Library of Congress, so the film is perceived to be public domain, although the music is very much copyrighted and every distributor of this movie is participating in copyright infringement by selling these "bootlegs".

The companies make the money, because they're selling OTHER people's property.

The people who ultimately suffer are YOU, THE CONSUMER, unknowingly buying products of inferior (worse than professional VHS) quality, thinking you're getting the real thing, because it's a DVD.

Save your money. Wait until Warner Bros. gives us the real thing
thing...

And by the way, the movie gets 4 stars, it's the cheapo bootleg DVD that gets 1 star!
