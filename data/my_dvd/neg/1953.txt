What a rip off! This is my very first bad experience with Amazon. Heck, this is the first time I haven't been extremely satisfied. 

Who in the world would purposely order a PSP disc of ANY movie?????? The heading for this item still incorrectly states that it is a two (2) disc set. It does not mention that it is in some stange format no one in their right mind would buy. You can imagine my surprise when I opened the case and found what looked like some kind of strange contraceptive device. Don't order this
