I think Denise Austin does a decent job in some of her other videos, but this isn't one of them.  She lacks any type of warm up in this one and often looks like she's just trying to make up steps in order to fill the time slot.  The moves are not well choreographed and very awkward.  Some may find encouragement in the times Denise gives the camera a bug eyed stare and says "We're burning butter.... yeah" but I found it annoying.  I think there are much better workouts for the money out there
