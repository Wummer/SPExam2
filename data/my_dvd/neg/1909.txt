Trash film usurps title. People that like this film seem to come from a group that have only seen ersatz films such as the new Mummy have nothing of real movie value to compare them to. This must also be a group that has never seen a live play or an old German film. 

The filmmakers attempted to capture a cross between Nosferatu. It may have worked in 1920 however the film is to clear and sharp. It comes off looking more like a cross between a cartoon and a graphics ad. 

The actors outweighed the characters and looked like they were reading the script. I could swear that some were watching the teleprompter. And who's idea was it to cut up a three day old corps to get covered in blood that if was any, had lone ago coagulated? I could go on with quite a few examples. But you get the idea. This should be helpful even if you liked the movie. 

If you are driving by a place that rents this DVD, stay in the car!
