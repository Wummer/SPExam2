The Gauntlet may rank as one of Clint Eastwood's worst movies.  It is so unrealistic and silly I frankly didn't want to even finish it.  Released in 1977 after a string of some really good westerns and Dirty Harry movies, it stands out as being a real stinker.

Here Eastwood plays a loser of a cop, Ben Shockley, who is sent on an assignment to pick up a witness in Las Vegas for a trial.  He's told it's a "nothing witness for a nothing case" so he thinks it'll be an easy assignment.  Well, poor Shockley finds out differently when not only the bad guys but the good guys are trying to kill him and his witness.  It seems some conspiracy is afoot.  The rest of the movie is Shockley, and his female witness, Gus Mally, running from cops and mobsters trying to kill them in increasingly ridiculous bad action scenes.  And plot is so ludicrously predictable it's pretty clear early on just who the bad guy behind the curtain is.

Unless you really, really like Clint Eastwood, this is one to forget.  I'll bet he wishes he could.
