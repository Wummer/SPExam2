Where to start with this bad movie?

As if the plot matters (it doesn't), the movie is about a woman and her sister who use hubbie's computer to access chat rooms, etc, and witness online killings, and of course, see the killer in a sort of "Eyes of Laura Mars" style.

The two lead males are played by non-actor musicians Roger Daltrey and Huey Lewis.
Lead females are played by former actresses Natassia Kinsky and Nicolette Sheridan.
The killer is played by a still-unknown actor.

Major problems:

1. Talking computers ("electronic chronometer activated").
2. People talking to computers as they type.
3. Never making a typo even when typing at an awkward angle and not looking at the keys (while talking to someone else).
4. Easy access to talking encrypted computer by using a microphone that you have to be an inch away from to use. And the computer selects only some of the words you say, as needed.
5. Really bad acting.
6. Un-sexy eroticism.
7. Over-technologized thoughout.

It might seem tempting to "save" 5 bucks, but you're wasting the other five dollars.
