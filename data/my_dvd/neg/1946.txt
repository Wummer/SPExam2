I expected so much more, because it's Marshall, but regardless of where you purchase this, IT'S EDITED. It's pathetic. This is Eminem! I understand you have a daughter Mr. Mathers, but DO NOT MAKE ALL OF US WATCH AN EDITED CONCERT. This is probably the MOST ridiculous thing I've ever bought. There's not even a warning that it's censored. You just buy it, pop it in your DVD player, and listen to a concert with mostly EVERY OTHER WORD jarbled up. It's a useless DVD. There's NO POINT in buying it. First Encore, now this. I've been a fan since the earlier parts of the 90's. As somebody from Michigan, I saw him before he was Mr. Cartier global super star buying skin treatments at Barneys. I've never been more disappointed with an artist.
