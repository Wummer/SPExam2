A friend and I tried watching this film once again recently, but still we both find it irritating and unpleasant.  From the beginning, when Katharine Hepburn's character destroys other people's cars without a care, we found one scene after another tedious and unfunny.  The acting is fine, as could be expected from such greats as Hepburn and Cary Grant.  But the characters are not sympathetic, fun or interesting.  Grant's character is an unassertive, spineless person who is easily dominated.  Hepburn's character is blindly selfish. Who could care what happens to them?  The one interesting element is the acting that is done in proximity to a live leopard.
