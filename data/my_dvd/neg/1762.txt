I love Stargate, and give the movie 5 stars. I own a VHS copy, and have watched it many times.

With that said this "Ultimate Edition" is not ultimate at all. There are no real special features. The documentary is a cheesy one that explores if there is a real stargate, but there are no...NO...behind the scenes/making of Star Gate insights at all. This documentary has nothing to do with the cast/crew/design/production of the movie. This does not, by any means, make this DVD ultimate. This DVD edition isn't ultimate at all, but extremely mediocre.

The only special feature on this disk is a producer/director audio commentary that can run during the movie. That's it. Really. No kidding
