Heavyweights was a quite a disappointment, considering the presence of Ben Stiller.
The movie sheds light on a popular summer camp for fat children that unexpectedly finds itself under different management.  The new administration will make it clear very soon that some major changes are to take place...  
The plot and the acting are surprisingly (!) average, while the humor and the dialogues are below average.  
Ben Stiller's character, a cross between Zoolander and Dodgeball (both being AMAZING movies), was unexpectedly plain and bland.
As for the rest of the cast, this film does not seem to be their thing.  
Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...  No masterpiece here.
