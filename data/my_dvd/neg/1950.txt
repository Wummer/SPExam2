I'm sorry folks, but I went into this one with high hopes given the outstanding reviews from both critics and laymen.  It would be a tremendous understatement to say I was disappointed.   This film is horrible in nearly every respect, but this is the film's fatal flaw: A "character study" is no good when the characters act in a manner which is counter intuitive and against the grain of human nature.  

The film portrays two convicts on death row as likeable guys who are willing to help out with this ridiculous standoff because they have no other choice.  Sorry to bring up the obvious here, but the ONLY thing any person would care about in that situation is escaping.  He would not be pre-occupied with helping defend the police station (he would have immediately shot the cop upon being given a gun); he would not be worried about "his chances out there" (remember he's on death row); he would be concerned only with escaping IMMEDIATELY. 

Sorry to all you fans of this "cult classic", but a movie in this vein must be at least SOMEWHAT realistic to gain my praise.  This one is a mess.
