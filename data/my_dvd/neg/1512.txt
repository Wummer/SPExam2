Someone bought this 3D DVD for my almost 5 year old daughter.  We thought the special effects would be fascinating and they were.  However,  within minutes of the movie's beginning my daughter was in tears. I won't say why but she found the plot frightening.  Several times during the movie I tried to talk her out of watching but she wanted to see what happened in the end.  Fortunately the movie is relatively short.  Overall, I found the story to be a cynical look at Christmas.  As an adult, I think it might be humourous to watch after a hard day of Christmas shopping but I urge caution before showing it to young children.  There was way too much animated violence to match the spirit of Christmas
